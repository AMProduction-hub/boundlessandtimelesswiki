## **Description**

Awanama, formally known as Aveeshena Trumbleweed, is the enigmatic and pragmatic Grand Adjudicator of Time and Plane. A master of foresight and planar analysis, he has overseen the Bureau for nearly a century, balancing cosmic interference with meticulous bureaucratic oversight. As one of the few individuals aware of the **true** nature of Ao’s plan, Awanama walks the fine line between acting as a servant of the Overgod and maintaining agency over his own decisions.

## **Appearance**

Awanama is a tall and slender high elf with piercing silver eyes, a constant reminder of his attunement to divination magic. His long, silver-threaded robes bear the insignia of the Bureau—an intricate ouroboros entwined with a cosmic hourglass. He carries a finely crafted **silver staff**, etched with runes that shimmer when he casts spells. Despite his composed exterior, those who look closely may notice faint wrinkles of stress around his eyes—an inevitable side effect of peering into too many possible futures.

## **Personality**

- **Pragmatic & Calculating:** Awanama makes decisions based on logic, probabilities, and long-term consequences. While not devoid of emotion, he suppresses personal feelings in favor of achieving the Bureau’s goals.

- **Dryly Humorous:** Despite his serious demeanor, he often employs wry humor, particularly when discussing the absurdity of bureaucracy or the ever-unraveling nature of the multiverse.

- **Mildly Overworked:** The weight of overseeing time and planar stability is immense. He frequently jokes about needing "an extra day between Tuesday and Wednesday" to catch up on reports.

- **Detached Yet Curious:** Knowing too much about the future makes him emotionally distant, but he finds unpredictable individuals (like the players) fascinating.

- **Selective with Trust:** He values competence and foresight above all, rewarding those who prove themselves but keeping true intentions close to his chest.

## **Abilities**
### **Arcane Mastery**

As a **Level 19 Divination Wizard**, Awanama possesses vast magical knowledge, particularly in foresight and altering probabilities.

- **Portent (Divination Feature):** He can replace rolls with predetermined numbers he foresaw at the start of each day.
- **Chronomantic Ward:** A personal time-based defensive measure that slows incoming attacks and diverts lethal blows.
- **Plane-Walking Expert:** Can navigate and open portals between planes with unmatched efficiency.

### **Tactician & Strategist**

- Awanama is not a combat-focused leader, but he excels in orchestrating battlefield conditions to ensure favorable outcomes.
- Prefers to **redirect**, **stall**, or **manipulate enemies’ fates** rather than engage in direct confrontation.

Whether the players see him as a **mentor, enigmatic ally, or manipulative overseer** depends on their interactions and choices throughout the campaign.
