## **Appearance**

Damian carries himself with a casual confidence, always dressed impeccably yet in a way that allows him to blend into any environment. His devilish heritage manifests subtly—perhaps in the way his eyes glint in the dark or the faint scent of brimstone that lingers when he leaves a room. He often wears a smirk, as if he knows a joke no one else is in on.

## **Personality & Mannerisms**

- **Suave & Sly:** Damian rarely raises his voice or rushes his words. He speaks in a measured tone, always choosing his words carefully.
- **Pragmatic & Unsentimental:** While he may seem friendly, he never lets emotions cloud his judgment. His primary concern is ensuring the Bureau’s interests are met, in whatever way necessary.
- **Always Watching:** He has an uncanny ability to show up at just the right moment, often when things have gone awry. He rarely intervenes unless absolutely necessary, preferring to let situations play out before stepping in to 'fix' things.
- **Dry Humor:** Damian is rarely outright hostile, instead choosing to make cutting remarks with a casual ease.

## **Role within the Bureau**

Damian’s official role is to **clean up after the players’ missions**—not with broom and mop, but by covering up unintended consequences, tying up loose ends, and ensuring that the Bureau’s plans remain on track. He operates autonomously, with little oversight, and seems to have more freedom than most contractors. Whether this is due to trust or simply because no one wants to question him remains unclear.

He has hinted that he has worked for many organizations, not just the Bureau, but never clarifies where his true loyalties lie.

## **Abilities & Skills**

- **Master Manipulator:** Damian excels at bending people to his will through conversation alone.
- **Combat Proficiency:** While he rarely fights openly, he is more than capable of defending himself when necessary.
- **Planar Knowledge:** As a cambion, he has an innate understanding of the planes and their workings.
- **Teleportation:** He has an uncanny ability to disappear and reappear when least expected.

## **Relationships & Motivations**

While Damian seems to be on the players’ side (for now), his ultimate motivations remain unclear. He has expressed interest in the artifacts they are retrieving, though he plays coy about his reasons. He offers explanations when convenient but always leaves just enough unsaid to keep others guessing.

**[GM Notes]**
- Damian should be played as a wildcard NPC—sometimes an ally, sometimes an obstacle, but always enigmatic.
- His true endgame should remain ambiguous for as long as possible. Even if the players pry, he should never confirm or deny anything outright.
- He should always seem one step ahead, but never omniscient—he simply has contingency plans for nearly everything.
