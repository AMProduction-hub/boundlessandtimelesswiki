## **Appearance**

Sebats is a human male in his early 40s, with sharp features and a lean, agile build. He has short, tousled dark hair with strands of premature gray and piercing green eyes that often reflect a knowing amusement. His attire consists of a well-worn but elegantly styled long coat, layered over lightweight armor ideal for quick movement. A distinctive **ruby-inlaid short sword** is always strapped to his hip, though he rarely draws it unless absolutely necessary.

---
## **Personality**

Sebats is **charming, adaptable, and dangerously unpredictable**. While he maintains an easygoing demeanor, beneath the surface lies a man haunted by past failures and driven by an insatiable need to prove himself. He has a knack for reading people and enjoys getting under their skin just enough to test their reactions. A natural trickster, he thrives in deception and subterfuge, though his loyalty to those he truly cares for is unwavering.

### **Traits & Habits:**

- **A Storyteller & Gambler:** Loves weaving tall tales, some true, some exaggerated, and keeps a personal journal of ‘the best lies ever told.’
- **Detached but Protective:** Rarely lets people in, but when he does, he would go to extreme lengths to keep them safe.
- **Thrill-Seeker:** Finds boredom unbearable and actively seeks danger, often under the guise of ‘calculated risk.’
- **Plays with Chance:** Carries a deck of playing cards, shuffling them absentmindedly when thinking or bluffing his way through a situation.
- **Keeps His Distance from His Past:** The ruby short sword given to him by a child he once saved is always with him, but he refuses to talk about it.

## **History**

### **Early Life & Criminal Past**

Sebats grew up in the lower districts of an unnamed city, where survival meant learning the art of deception. As a young adult, he became involved in **high-stakes heists**, working alongside a crew of talented criminals. However, a **botched job** led to the deaths of his closest allies, an event that left him deeply scarred and reluctant to trust again.

### **The Event of the Wicked Witch of the East**

His life took a dramatic turn when he was pulled into a conflict known as **The Event of the Wicked Witch of the East**. During this time, he:

- Fought against the powerful wizard **Jeno**.
- Was tasked with escorting a **child who held the power to defeat the wicked witch** to the Golden City.
- Received the **ruby short sword** as a parting gift from the child.

Though he succeeded in his mission, the experience left him questioning his purpose.

### **Induction into the Bureau**

Some years later, Sebats found himself **summoned by the Bureau of Time and Plane**, where Awanama recognized his talents and offered him a position. Though initially skeptical, Sebats saw the Bureau as a means to gain access to places and knowledge he could never reach on his own. Over time, he became one of their most **valuable covert operatives**, though his tendency to bend the rules often frustrates his superiors.

## **Relationships**

### **[[Awanama - Leader of Bureau|Awanama]]**

Sebats treats the Grand Adjudicator with a mix of **respect and irreverence**, often testing how much he can get away with before being reprimanded. While he follows orders (mostly), he is known to work around bureaucracy when it suits him.

### **[[Pustakawan - Second-in-Command|Pustakawan]]**

The only person who truly knows Sebats, **Pustakawan is both his lover and his anchor**. Though they keep their relationship professional in the Bureau, their bond is undeniable. They share a child, whom Sebats rarely speaks of for fear of putting them in danger.

### **The Players**

As a superior agent, Sebats often interacts with the players in the field. While not officially their mentor, he enjoys testing their skills, occasionally betting on their success or failure. He can be a valuable ally, but players should be wary—**he always has his own angle**.

### **[[Damian - The Squeeky Devils|Damian]]**

Sebats sees Damian as **a rival and an enigma**. He recognizes the cambion’s influence over multiple organizations and keeps a wary eye on his movements. The two have crossed paths before, and while no open hostility exists, there is an unspoken understanding that one may have to eliminate the other someday.
