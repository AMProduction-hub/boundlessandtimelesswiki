# Skills System

This house rule allows characters to gain additional skill proficiencies and improve existing skills to unlock powerful abilities as they level up.

## Skill Progression Overview

Starting at **level 3**, you gain one skill increase every **2 levels**. You can choose to either:
- Gain proficiency in a **new skill**, OR
- Improve an **existing skill** to the next Expertise Level

{{< hint info >}}
**Rogues** are the undisputed skill masters: they gain a skill increase **every level** instead of every 2 levels!

**Double your proficiency bonus** for this skill.

*Example*: If your proficiency bonus is +3, you add +6 to this skill instead.

### Expertise Level 2 (Available at Level 9+)
Unlocks a **minor special effect** (see table below).

### Expertise Level 3 (Available at Level 13+)
Unlocks a **major combat or utility effect** (see table below).

### Expertise Level 4 (Available at Level 17+)
Unlocks a **legendary effect** (see table below).

## How to Use Skill Increases

When you reach a level that grants a skill increase, you have two options:

### Option 1: Learn a New Skill
If you're not proficient in a skill, you can gain proficiency in it.
- You add your proficiency bonus to checks using this skill
- You can now attempt checks that require proficiency

### Option 2: Improve an Existing Skill
If you're already proficient in a skill, you can improve it to the next Expertise Level.
- **First improvement** → Expertise Level 1 (double proficiency)
- **Second improvement** → Expertise Level 2 (minor effect)
- **Third improvement** → Expertise Level 3 (major effect)
- **Fourth improvement** → Expertise Level 4 (legendary effect)

{{< hint warning >}}
**Important**: You can only improve skills you're already proficient in. You must have the skill before you can improve it!

## Example Progression

Here's an example of how a Rogue might develop their skills:

| Level | Choice | Result |
|:-----:|:-------|:-------|
| **1** | Start with Stealth proficiency | +2 to Stealth (Prof bonus) |
| **3** | Improve Stealth | Expertise Level 1: +4 to Stealth |
| **5** | Learn Investigation | +3 to Investigation (Prof bonus) |
| **7** | Improve Stealth | Level 2: Can hide while being watched |
| **9** | Improve Investigation | Expertise Level 1: +6 to Investigation |
| **11** | Improve Stealth | Level 3: Can move silently in armor |

## Strategic Considerations

### Breadth vs. Depth
- **Breadth**: Learning many skills makes you versatile
- **Depth**: Improving a few skills to high levels makes you a master

### Party Synergy
- Consider what skills your party needs
- Avoid too much overlap unless you want to specialize
- High Expertise levels can define your character's role

### Combat vs. Utility
- Some Expertise effects are useful in combat (Acrobatics, Athletics, Perception)
- Others shine in exploration and social encounters (Investigation, Persuasion, Stealth)

{{< hint tip >}}
**Recommendation**: Reach Expertise Level 1 in your core skills first (double proficiency is powerful), then decide whether to specialize further or diversify.

*This system makes skill checks matter at all levels and gives non-spellcasters more options outside combat!*
