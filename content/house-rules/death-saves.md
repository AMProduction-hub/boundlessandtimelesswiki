# Death Saving Throws
## *Lingering Wounds & Safe Havens*

---

## 📜 Standard 5e Rules (Quick Reminder)

When your Hit Points drop to 0, you fall unconscious and begin making Death Saving Throws:

- **Roll 1d20** vs **DC 10** at the start of your turn
- **3 Successes** = You stabilize with 1 HP
- **3 Failures** = Your character dies
- **Natural 20** = You immediately wake up with 1 HP

## ⚔️ House Rule: Persistent Death Save Failures

**In this campaign, death is more persistent.** Failed death saves leave lasting wounds that don't go away when you're revived.

### How It Works

When you fail a Death Saving Throw, that **Failure slot remains marked** even after you're healed or stabilized.

**Example:**
1. You drop to 0 HP and fail 2 death saves before being healed
2. You wake up with HP restored
3. **But those 2 failure slots remain crossed out**
4. Later, you drop to 0 HP again
5. You now only have **1 failure left** before permanent death

### The Deadly Consequence

{{< hint danger >}}
**💀 If all 3 Failure slots are marked:** The next time you drop to 0 HP, **you die instantly** with no Death Saving Throws.
{{< /hint >}}

## 🛡️ Recovering Failure Slots: Safe Spots

The only way to clear your marked Failure slots is by taking a **Long Rest at a Safe Spot**.

### What is a Safe Spot?

Safe Spots are secure locations designated by the DM where your character can truly rest and recover:
- **Sanctified temples**
- **Fortified taverns**
- **Protected campsites**
- **Friendly strongholds**
- **Bureau safehouses**

{{< hint info >}}
**🏕️ Safe Spots** are clearly marked by the DM. When in doubt, ask: "Is this location safe enough for full recovery?"
{{< /hint >}}

### Full Recovery

When you complete a **Long Rest at a Safe Spot**:
- ✅ All HP restored (as normal)
- ✅ All spell slots restored (as normal)
- ✅ All hit dice restored (as normal)
- ✅ **All Death Save Failure slots cleared**

## 📊 Tracking Your Death Save Status

Keep track of your Death Save status on your character sheet:

**Death Save Failures:**
```
○ ○ ○  (All clear - fresh character)
☒ ○ ○  (1 failure marked)
☒ ☒ ○  (2 failures marked - getting dangerous!)
☒ ☒ ☒  (3 failures marked - next time you drop, you're DEAD)
```

{{< hint warning >}}
**⚠️ Critical Status:** If you have 2 or 3 failures marked, **prioritize finding a Safe Spot** before your next dangerous encounter!
{{< /hint >}}

## 💡 Strategic Implications

This house rule creates meaningful choices:

**Risk Management**
- Consider retreating to Safe Spots before failures pile up
- Don't push into dangerous areas with marked failures
- Healing Word becomes even more valuable

**Party Coordination**
- Protect characters with multiple failures marked
- Plan routes that include Safe Spot access
- Consider the risk/reward of continuing vs resting

**Resource Balance**
- Healing items are more precious
- Safe Spots become strategic goals
- Death is a real, persistent threat

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do failures reset on a Short Rest?**  
A: No, only a Long Rest **at a Safe Spot** clears failures.

**Q: Can I long rest anywhere to clear failures?**  
A: No, you must be at a DM-designated Safe Spot.

**Q: What if I'm revived after dying with 3 failures?**  
A: Resurrection magic (Revivify, Raise Dead, etc.) brings you back to life but **does not** clear failure slots. You'll need to reach a Safe Spot.

**Q: Do magical healing effects clear failure slots?**  
A: No, only Long Rests at Safe Spots clear them.

**Q: Can NPCs have marked failures too?**  
A: At DM discretion. Important NPCs might, but most enemies don't track this.

## 🎭 Roleplaying Death Save Failures

These persistent wounds aren't just mechanical—they're story opportunities:

**1 Failure Marked:**
> *"Your vision still blurs at the edges. That near-death experience left its mark."*

**2 Failures Marked:**
> *"You feel Death's cold touch lingering. Your hands tremble slightly, remembering how close you came."*

**3 Failures Marked:**
> *"You're living on borrowed time. One more mistake, one more moment of carelessness, and it's over. The others see it in your eyes—the shadow of mortality."*

## 🛡️ Why This Rule Exists

This house rule adds:
- **Tension**: Death becomes more real and threatening
- **Strategy**: Safe Spots become important tactical goals
- **Story Weight**: Near-death experiences have lasting impact
- **Consequences**: Reckless play has real costs
- **Drama**: Creates memorable "barely survived" moments
