# Character Advancement

In standard D&D 5e, you must choose between an Ability Score Improvement (ASI) or a Feat every 4 levels. This house rule **separates ASI and Feats**, allowing you to gain both independently.

## Ability Score Improvements (ASI)

Instead of choosing between ASI and Feats, you now automatically receive **+2 ASI every 4 levels**, starting at level 2.

### ASI Progression Table

| Level | Ability Score Improvement |
|:-----:|:------------------------:|
| **2** | +2 points (can be split) |
| **6** | +2 points |
| **10** | +2 points |
| **14** | +2 points |
| **18** | +2 points |

### How It Works

- You receive +2 points to distribute among your ability scores
- You can put both points into one ability (e.g., +2 Strength)
- Or split them between two abilities (e.g., +1 Strength, +1 Dexterity)
- Ability scores still cap at 20 (unless you have special features that increase this)

{{< hint info >}}
**Example**: A level 6 Fighter with 16 Strength could increase it to 18, or increase Strength to 17 and Constitution to 15 (if it was 14).

## Feats

Feats are now gained **separately** from ASI, allowing you to customize your character without sacrificing ability score growth.

### Feat Progression Table

| Level | Feats Gained |
|:-----:|:-----------:|
| **4** | 1 Feat |
| **8** | 1 Feat |
| **12** | 1 Feat |
| **16** | 1 Feat |
| **20** | 1 Feat |

### Important Notes

- Feats are gained based on **total character level**, not class level
- If you multiclass, you still gain feats at these levels
- You can choose any feat you qualify for (check prerequisites)
- Variant Human and Custom Lineage still get their bonus feat at level 1

{{< hint warning >}}
**Multiclass Example**: If you're a Fighter 3/Wizard 1 (total level 4), you gain a feat at level 4, not when you reach Fighter 4.

## Combined Progression Example

Here's what a character's progression looks like through the first 8 levels:

| Level | ASI | Feat | Total Ability Improvements |
|:-----:|:---:|:----:|:--------------------------|
| **1** | — | — | Starting ability scores |
| **2** | +2 | — | Increased one or two abilities |
| **3** | — | — | — |
| **4** | — | ✓ | Gained first feat |
| **5** | — | — | — |
| **6** | +2 | — | Increased abilities again |
| **7** | — | — | — |
| **8** | — | ✓ | Gained second feat |

## Why This Change?

This house rule addresses several design issues in standard 5e:

1. **More Customization**: Players don't have to choose between being effective (ASI) and being interesting (Feats)
2. **Better Balance**: Martial classes benefit greatly from both ASI and Feats
3. **Faster Power Growth**: Characters reach their optimal ability scores faster
4. **More Fun**: Players get to explore more feat combinations

{{< hint tip >}}
**Strategic Tip**: Plan your ASI and Feat choices together! Some feats synergize well with specific ability scores.
