# Spell Scaling & Character Tiers

This house rule introduces a **tier system** that affects how spells work against different enemies, making high-level encounters more challenging and strategic.

---

## Character Tiers Overview

Characters and creatures are divided into 4 tiers based on their level or Challenge Rating (CR). Higher-tier creatures are more resistant to spells from lower-tier casters, while lower-tier creatures are more vulnerable to spells from higher-tier casters.

### Tier Table

| Tier | Character Level | Creature CR | Description |
|:----:|:---------------:|:-----------:|:------------|
| **Tier 1** | 1–4 | CR ⅛ – CR 4 | Local Heroes |
| **Tier 2** | 5–10 | CR 5 – CR 10 | Heroes of the Realms |
| **Tier 3** | 11–16 | CR 11 – CR 16 | Masters of the Realms |
| **Tier 4** | 17–20 | CR 17+ | Masters of the World |

{{< hint info >}}
**Your current tier determines your spell effectiveness** against enemies of different tiers.

## How Tiers Affect Spells

The tier difference between caster and target affects spell strength in two ways:

### Against Higher-Tier Enemies (Weakened Effects)
When you cast a spell on an enemy whose tier is **higher** than yours:
- Crowd control spells have reduced effects
- Damage spells deal less damage on saves
- The enemy is more resistant overall

### Against Lower-Tier Enemies (Enhanced Effects)
When you cast a spell on an enemy whose tier is **lower** than yours:
- Your spells are more potent
- Save-or-suck effects last longer
- Damage can be dramatically increased

---

## Weakened Effects (Casting on Higher-Tier Enemies)

When casting spells on enemies of a **higher tier**, effects are reduced:

| Spell Type | Weakened Effect |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| **Save-or-Suck** (Paralysis, Polymorph, Banishment) | **Partial effect** instead of full effect. *Hold Monster* only stuns for 1 turn, *Polymorph* reduces speed & AC instead of transforming, etc. |
| **Charm & Mind Control** (Dominate, Suggestion, Fear) | Target gets an **extra save every round**. Full effect only if they fail by **10 or more**. |
| **Damage Spells** (Fireball, Disintegrate) | Target **resists half damage** if they save by **5 or more**. |
| **Debuffs** (Bane, Slow, Bestow Curse) | Effects are **halved** (e.g., *Slow* only reduces movement, *Bestow Curse* lasts fewer rounds). |
| **Summoning** (Conjure Animals, Planar Binding) | Summoned creatures have **fewer hit points** or weaker stats. |
| **Control Spells** (Wall of Force, Telekinesis) | Target can **interact with or resist** more easily (e.g., a Tier 4 creature can break *Wall of Force* with an action). |
| **Healing & Buffs** (Bless, Shield) | **No change** unless a higher-tier creature is negating them (anti-magic field). |

### Example: Tier 2 vs. Tier 3 Enemy

**A Level 8 Sorcerer (Tier 2) casts *Hold Person* on a CR 15 Lich (Tier 3)**
- Normal effect: Target is paralyzed
- **Weakened effect**: Lich loses its next **bonus action** instead of being paralyzed
- If the Lich fails by 10 or more, it gets the full paralyzed effect

---

## Enhanced Effects (Casting on Lower-Tier Enemies)

When casting spells on enemies of a **lower tier**, effects are empowered:

| Spell Type | Enhanced Effect |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| **Save-or-Suck Spells** | If target fails by **10 or more**, they suffer **double duration** or **lose their next turn entirely**. |
| **Charm & Mind Control** | **No extra saves** allowed. Full effect applies. |
| **Damage Spells** | On a failed save by **10 or more**, damage **doubles** (like a critical hit). |
| **Debuffs** | **No immunity**. Effects that normally wouldn't work on certain creatures now apply. |
| **Summoning** | Summoned creatures have **bonus HP and attack rolls**. |
| **Control Spells** | Spell's **range, duration, or area increases**. |
| **Healing & Buffs** | Targets gain **extra temporary HP or resistances**. |

### Example: Tier 4 vs. Tier 2 Enemy

**A Level 18 Cleric (Tier 4) casts *Banishment* on a CR 9 Giant (Tier 2)**
- Normal effect: Giant is banished for 1 minute (concentration)
- **Enhanced effect**: If Giant fails by 10 or more, it is **banished permanently** (no concentration needed)

---

## Tier Difference Mechanics

The key mechanic is **how much the target fails their save by**:

### Normal Save (Fail by 1-4)
- Standard spell effect applies
- No tier modifications

### Significant Fail (Fail by 5-9)
- **Higher-tier targets**: Weakened effect applies
- **Lower-tier targets**: Standard effect, possibly extended duration

### Critical Fail (Fail by 10+)
- **Higher-tier targets**: Full spell effect applies
- **Lower-tier targets**: Enhanced effect applies (double damage, extended duration, no saves)

{{< hint warning >}}
**Important**: The tier system applies to **enemies and bosses**, not to allies or willing targets!
{{< /hint >}}

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Tier 2 Wizard vs. Tier 3 Boss
**Level 6 Bard (Tier 2) casts *Fear* on a CR 20 Balor (Tier 4)**
- The Balor has **advantage on the save** (2 tiers higher)
- On a normal failure: Balor only loses its **next reaction** instead of fleeing
- On a critical failure (fail by 10+): Balor is frightened normally

### Example 2: Tier 3 Sorcerer vs. Tier 2 Enemy
**Level 16 Wizard (Tier 3) casts *Fireball* on a CR 6 Troll (Tier 2)**
- Troll makes a DEX save: rolls 9, needs 15 to save (fails by 6)
- Normal damage: 8d6 fire damage
- **Enhanced**: Troll fails by less than 10, so takes normal damage
- If Troll had failed by 10+, it would take **double damage** (critical hit effect)

### Example 3: Tier 2 Cleric vs. Tier 4 Dragon
**Level 8 Cleric (Tier 2) casts *Hold Monster* on an Ancient Red Dragon (Tier 4)**
- Dragon makes a WIS save and fails by 3
- Normal effect: Paralyzed
- **Weakened effect**: Dragon is only **stunned until end of caster's next turn**
- Dragon cannot be fully paralyzed unless it fails by 10+

### Example 4: Equal Tiers
**Level 12 Warlock (Tier 3) casts *Dominate Person* on a Mind Flayer (CR 13, Tier 3)**
- Both are Tier 3, so **no tier modifications**
- Spell works exactly as written in the rules
- Mind Flayer gets normal saves

## Why This System Exists

### Problems It Solves
1. **Save-or-Suck Spells**: High-level bosses are no longer instantly defeated by a single failed save
2. **Challenge Scaling**: Makes high-CR encounters feel appropriately challenging
3. **Strategic Casting**: Casters must think tactically about which spells to use
4. **Power Fantasy**: Lower-tier enemies are still easily controlled, maintaining the power fantasy

### Design Philosophy
- **Bosses should be boss fights**: They shouldn't be trivialized by one spell
- **Legendary Resistances are replaced**: Instead of auto-succeeding, bosses get partial effects
- **Progression feels meaningful**: As you advance tiers, you become more powerful

---

## Strategic Considerations for Casters

### Against Higher-Tier Enemies
- Focus on **damage spells** instead of save-or-suck
- Use **debuffs that don't rely on saves** (e.g., *Magic Missile*, *Spiritual Weapon*)
- Stack multiple effects to overwhelm their defenses
- Work with teammates to reduce saves (e.g., Bane, Cutting Words)

### Against Lower-Tier Enemies
- **Save-or-suck spells are powerful** and reliable
- You can control entire groups with area-effect spells
- Single-target crowd control is extremely effective
- Feel free to be creative with your spell choices

### Equal-Tier Encounters
- Spells work as written in the rulebook
- Standard 5e balance applies
- Use your best judgment and tactics

## Quick Reference Chart

| Your Tier | Enemy Tier | Effect |
|:---------:|:----------:|:-------|
| Lower | Higher | Your spells are weakened |
| Equal | Equal | Standard 5e rules |
| Higher | Lower | Your spells are enhanced |

### Save Margin Matters

| Save Result | Against Higher Tier | Against Lower Tier |
|:-----------|:-------------------|:------------------|
| **Fail by 1-4** | Weakened effect | Normal effect |
| **Fail by 5-9** | Weakened effect | Extended duration |
| **Fail by 10+** | Full effect | Enhanced effect |

---

## GM Notes

### Balancing Encounters
- Use tier differences to make boss fights challenging without adding Legendary Resistances
- Lower-tier minions should feel easy to control
- Same-tier encounters play like standard 5e

### Adjudicating Partial Effects
When a spell has a weakened effect, use these guidelines:
- **Paralyzed** → Stunned for 1 round
- **Restrained** → Speed reduced by half
- **Charmed** → Gets extra saves each round
- **Transformed** → Reduces stats instead (AC, speed, damage)
- **Banished** → Returns after 1 round instead of 1 minute

{{< hint tip >}}
**For Players**: Don't be discouraged when fighting higher-tier enemies! Your spells still matter—they just won't instantly win the fight. Work together and be strategic!
