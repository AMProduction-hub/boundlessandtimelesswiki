# Henchmen
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy, p. 108* 

The characters presented in this chapter can be used as the henchmen for your campaign villain, even if they aren't intended as such. They can also be used as unusual allies for your player characters or boss monsters for a side adventure. You might also want to use them as a random encounter for high level groups.
