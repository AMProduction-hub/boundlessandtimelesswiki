# [Lantern Archon](03 - Player Log & Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\celestial/lantern-archon-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 17, Sigil and the Outlands*  

The lowest-ranked archons, lantern archons greet newly arrived souls to Mount Celestia and light the path for those who traverse the plane with reverence and respect. They appear as glowing, winged balls of vaporous light wrapped in a gleaming metal lattice, although they have no more physical substance than smoke.

When confronting those who approach with ill intentions, lantern archons strike with searing bolts of focused light, flitting from place to place between blasts to confound their foes.

## Archons

Archons are denizens of the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia. Created by the powers of order and benevolence, archons defend their home from fiendish incursions and safeguard those threatened by wicked forces. Archons are skilled communicators, able to speak all the languages of the multiverse. When pushed into combat, they prefer to subdue foes. However, against Fiends, archons are wrathful combatants, manifesting the righteous vengeance of Mount Celestia to strike down the wicked.

Each archon's form corresponds to its place within the Celestial hierarchy. When faced in battle, archons radiate the full fury of the Upper Planes, bolstering their allies and cowing their foes.
