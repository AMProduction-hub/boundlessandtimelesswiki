# [Sunfly](03 - Player Log & Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\celestial/sunfly-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 47, Sigil and the Outlands*  

Sunflies are whimsical, buzzing inhabitants of the Outer Planes. They travel widely and are important indicators of the health of the realms in which they reside; when sunflies struggle, so do the places they inhabit. Sunflies have stingers that they use to inject natural toxins into other creatures. Planar magic can alter a sunfly's toxin so that its effect is different depending on which Outer Plane the sunfly is on.

Many inhabitants of the planes have strong feelings about sunflies, viewing them as loathsome pests or adorable pets. Sunflies in Sigil are often the pets of doting, highly protective owners.
