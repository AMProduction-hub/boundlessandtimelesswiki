These fey come into being when the home tree of a dryad is destroyed or becomes corrupted by foul magic. If the dryad isn't killed she slowly wastes away and over the course of several months becomes a hamadryad. Hamadryads are mad creatures that seek vengeance against any non-fey that wanders into the deep places of the wood that is their home.

## Beauty Lost

Hamadryads do not retain the beauty that they had before whatever tragedy befell them. Their mouths have vanished and their laughter is forever gone. The beautiful feminine forms dryads are famed for have become twisted. Their emerald skin is grey and sickly and their very touch is corrupt and poisonous.

## Madness

Hamadryads rarely behave in a manner that seems rational. They might viciously attack an intruder and then vanish, only to return later when their mood changes. Sometimes they might help a group of adventurers against evil creatures only to turn on the adventurers once their mutual foe is vanquished.
