# [Septon Modron](03 - Player Log & Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\construct/septon-modron-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 40, Sigil and the Outlands*  

Septons are auditors of base modrons in Mechanus, recording the activities in each of the plane's sectors to ensure operations are in perfect order. They are easily identified by their seven flexible limbs.

## Modrons

Constructed on the plane of Mechanus, modrons are partially mechanical beings that belong to a strict hierarchy. Each modron dutifully obeys commands from the rank directly above it and in turn acts as the superior to the rank directly below it, passing down commands from paragons of law to the lowliest monodrone. While most modrons are the lower-ranked base modrons—monodrones, duodrones, tridrones, quadrones, and pentadrones—the upper-tier hierarch modrons hold leadership positions, maintaining order in Mechanus and the realms beyond. For more information on modrons, see the*Monster Manual*.
