**Outlands Aberrations**

`dice: [](outlands-aberrations-mpp.md#^outlands-aberrations)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | An [aboleth](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) travels in a muck-filled, orbicular carriage, seeking to better understand the Outer Planes in preparation for a future world-domination scheme. |
| 2 | A [beholder](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) influenced by "the Abyss" has compound eyes and looks like a floating, cyclopean fly head. It promises not to destroy the characters if they bring it a corpse it has never tasted before. |
| 3 | A dejected [red slaad](red-slaad.md) wishes to be reunited with its [slaad tadpole](slaad-tadpole.md), but it isn't certain where—or in what—it implanted its egg. |
| 4 | A hirsute, axe-wielding [flumph](flumph.md) influenced by "Ysgard" quests across the land, seeking legendary beasts to slay and epic songs to sing. |
