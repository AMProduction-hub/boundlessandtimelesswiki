| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | An [ancient gold dragon](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-gold-dragon.md) disguised as a canary gives the characters a nonmagical item and offers them Bahamut's best wishes. |
| 2 | A lawful good [faerie dragon](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-violet.md) with wings like stained glass has been influenced by "Mount Celestia". It seeks the characters' aid in recovering a stolen [holy avenger](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/items/holy-avenger.md). |
| 3 | A [time dragon wyrmling](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/time-dragon-wyrmling-mpp.md) (presented later in this book) wants help constructing a magical structure that will be important in the future. |
| 4 | A neutral evil [adult silver dragon](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-silver-dragon.md) with dull, gray scales has been influenced by "Hades". It demands a toll from any who crosses its domain. |
