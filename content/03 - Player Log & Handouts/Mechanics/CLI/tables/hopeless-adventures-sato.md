| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | The party is caught red-handed after a mean-spirited [goblin](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) makeup artist ambushes them with a splash of magic paint. Two [beholders](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) demand the characters perform at the "Gallows" or be disintegrated where they stand. |
| 2 | Commanded by its superiors in Hades, a [nycaloth](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/nycaloth.md) bubbles up through the Wishless Well and begins hunting members of the resistance in Hopeless. |
| 3 | High Cardinal Thingol hires the characters to catch the Jester, a costumed vigilante ([mage](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) in possession of a wand that spreads joy. |
| 4 | A [baernaloth](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/baernaloth-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") whispers to the characters through the Wishless Well, offering to trade ancient secrets for the Maiden of Misery's true identity. |
