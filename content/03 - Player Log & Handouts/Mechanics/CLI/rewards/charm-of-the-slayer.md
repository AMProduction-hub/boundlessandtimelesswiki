# Charm of the Slayer

One sword in your possession becomes a [dragon slayer](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/items/dragon-slayer.md) or [giant slayer](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/items/giant-slayer.md) (DM's choice) for the next 9 days. The charm then vanishes from you and the weapon returns to normal.
