# Message
*cantrip, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
- **Duration:** 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

**Classes**: [Artificer](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-artificer.md); [Bard](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight.md); [Sorcerer](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Cleric (Arcana Domain)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric-arcana-domain-scag.md "subclass=SCAG"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster.md); [Wizard](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
