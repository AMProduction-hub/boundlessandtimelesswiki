# Protection from Evil and Good
*1st-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [charmed](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), [frightened](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or possessed by them. If the target is already [charmed](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), [frightened](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

**Classes**: [Druid](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Cleric](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Bard](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer (Clockwork Soul)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer-clockwork-soul-tce.md "subclass=TCE"); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fighter-eldritch-knight.md); [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin-oath-of-devotion.md); [Ranger (Monster Slayer)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger-monster-slayer-xge.md "subclass=XGE"); [Paladin](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Ranger (Horizon Walker)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger-horizon-walker-xge.md "subclass=XGE"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-rogue-arcane-trickster.md); [Wizard](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Warlock](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE")
