# Power Word Stun
*8th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is [stunned](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned). Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The [stunned](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

**Classes**: [Bard](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Sorcerer](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Cleric (Arcana Domain)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric-arcana-domain-scag.md "subclass=SCAG"); [Warlock](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md)
