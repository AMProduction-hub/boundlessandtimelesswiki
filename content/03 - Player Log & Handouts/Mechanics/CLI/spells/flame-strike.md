# Flame Strike
*5th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (pinch of sulfur)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `4d6` fire damage and `4d6` radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 5th.
