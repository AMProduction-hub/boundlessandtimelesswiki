# Necklace of Adaptation
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/items/img/necklace-of-adaptation.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as [cloudkill](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/cloudkill.md) and [stinking cloud](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/stinking-cloud.md) effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
