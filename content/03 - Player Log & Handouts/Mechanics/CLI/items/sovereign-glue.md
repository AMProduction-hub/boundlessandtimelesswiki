# Sovereign Glue
*Wondrous item, minor, legendary*  
![](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/items/img/sovereign-glue.webp#right)


This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [oil of slipperiness](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/items/oil-of-slipperiness.md). When found, a container contains `1d6 + 1` ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [universal solvent](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/items/universal-solvent.md) or [oil of etherealness](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/items/oil-of-etherealness.md), or with a [wish](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell.
