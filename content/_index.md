## 🎯 My GMing Philosophy

**Player Agency First**: Your choices matter and shape the world.

**Rule of Cool**: If it's awesome and makes sense narratively, we'll make it work.

**Collaborative Storytelling**: We build the story together, not just me telling it to you.

**Meaningful Consequences**: Actions have weight, both good and bad.

**Fun Over Rules**: The rules serve the story, not the other way around.
