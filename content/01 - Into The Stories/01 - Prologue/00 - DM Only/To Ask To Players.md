# ASK TO PLAYER'S CHAR
- **The Bureau’s First Impression**
    - When the players arrive, how does the Grand Library feel? Do they see endless corridors of books, or do they feel a weight—like history itself pressing down on them? Maybe the air is filled with whispers of knowledge, pages turning by themselves, or distant echoes of past conversations.
    
    - The Bureau agents could be mysterious yet efficient, treating the players with clinical professionalism, as if they are just another variable in a cosmic equation.

- **Hints of Damian**
    - Instead of appearing directly, his presence could be subtle:
        - A document signed with his codename, *Contractor #666* .
        - A passing mention: “If Damian were here, he would have handled this differently.”
        - An old recording of his voice giving a cryptic remark about past agents who failed their tasks.
    
    - This keeps him enigmatic and builds curiosity before he makes a personal appearance.

- **A Decision Point for Players**
    
    - The Bureau doesn’t just hire anyone. Perhaps the players must prove their worth in some way:
        - A **moral dilemma**: They are given an option to retrieve an artifact but must decide whether to follow orders blindly or question its purpose.
        - A **combat scenario**: A simulated battle (maybe an illusion test) to gauge their reaction under pressure.
        - A **philosophical question**: The Bureau might test their worldview—"Would you erase a timeline to save another?"—to see where they stand.
    
    - Their choices might not change the story immediately, but they will set the tone for how the Bureau views them.

### 1️⃣ **Player Agency & Interactive Elements**

Right now, the prologue flows like a narrative cutscene. While that’s great for setting the mood, adding **small choices or reactions** for the players would help them feel engaged rather than just passive observers. For example:

- When the players **receive the invitation**, let them describe:
    
    > _Where were you when the invitation found you?_  
    > _What were you doing in Neverwinter?_  
    > _Did you expect something like this, or was it completely out of the blue?_
    
- During **the meeting in Lonesome Tavern**, the mysterious agent could observe something about the players:
    
    > _"Your reputation precedes you. I’ve heard of your exploits in [insert player's backstory feat]. But tell me, do you consider that a triumph… or a mistake?"_  
    > This forces the player to reflect on their past deeds and makes their personal history relevant to the story.

### 2️⃣ **More Sensory Details & Atmosphere**

- You could **enhance the mystery** of the Lonesome Tavern by adding surreal elements:
    
    > _The fireplace is burning, but there’s no warmth._  
    > _The bartender doesn’t speak, only nods when you order._  
    > _A shadow flickers on the wall, but no one is casting it._  
    > These **subtle hints** will make players uneasy without making it obvious that magic is involved.
    
- The **Grand Library’s transition** can be even more vivid:
    
    > _Your vision is filled with blinding glyphs, ancient runes swirling around you like a storm. Then, silence. You are no longer in Neverwinter. No longer in the world you knew._

### 3️⃣ **Foreshadowing the Bigger Mystery**

- The agent from The Bureau could drop **cryptic hints** about the future:
    
    > _"You are being called because reality is unraveling. Something is moving in the shadows, something older than the gods themselves."_
    
- Maybe **other figures are watching** from the background:
    
    > _As you speak with the agent, you catch a glimpse of a hooded figure in the corner. When you turn back, they’re gone…_  
    > Is it **Lucian**? Another Bureau agent? A rival faction? Let the players wonder.

### 4️⃣ **Introducing a Conflict or Ticking Clock**

- Right now, the prologue is a **recruitment scene**, but adding **urgency** could make it even better. Maybe:
    
    - A **strange anomaly** is happening in Neverwinter, and The Bureau is acting fast.
        
    - The invitation **wasn’t sent to just them**—someone **else** has been recruited, and they are not trustworthy.
        
    - A **third party** is trying to **stop the meeting**—maybe players are ambushed before reaching Lonesome Tavern.
        

This makes it feel like the players were recruited **not just because they are worthy, but because time is running out**.

### 5️⃣ **A Stronger Closing Hook**

The **Grand Library reveal** is excellent, but what if **one last thing** happens that makes players go, _“Oh sh_t, what did we just sign up for?”*

- They see a **massive artifact** locked behind chains in the Grand Library, pulsing with energy. The agent simply says, _"This is what we need you to find more of."_
    
- They hear a **distant voice**—maybe **Ao himself** whispering something ominous, but no one acknowledges it.
    
- A **book floats in front of them**, opening by itself, showing **their own future deeds written down**—but the pages ahead are blank.
