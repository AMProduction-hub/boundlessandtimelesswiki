## Campaign Philosophy

Each campaign I run has these core principles:

**Player-Driven Stories**: Your choices drive the narrative forward.

**Living Worlds**: The world continues whether you're there or not. NPCs have their own goals.

**Consequences Matter**: Actions have ripples. Some immediate, some that surface sessions later.

**Multiple Solutions**: There's rarely one "correct" way to solve a problem.

**Tone Consistency**: Each campaign has its own tone, from serious to silly.
