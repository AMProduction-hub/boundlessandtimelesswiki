## *The People and Places That Shape Your Journey*

## 🗺️ About This Section

The multiverse is vast, but your story unfolds in specific places among particular people. This section catalogs the **locations you'll visit** and the **NPCs you'll encounter**—allies, enemies, questgivers, and those whose allegiances remain unclear.

Each location has its own character, challenges, and cast of memorable figures. Understanding these places and the people who inhabit them is key to navigating the crises threatening reality itself.
