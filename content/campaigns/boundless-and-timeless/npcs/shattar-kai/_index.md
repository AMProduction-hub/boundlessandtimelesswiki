### Survival Tips

1. **Choose Sides Carefully**: Neutrality won't protect you
2. **Respect the Ceasefire**: When it's active. It won't last.
3. **Don't Trust Alliances**: They're all temporary
4. **Protect Civilians**: They're the only innocents left
5. **Understand Honor**: It means everything here, even when it's stupid

### The War Nobody Wins

This conflict has no heroes:
- Both sides have legitimate grievances
- Both sides have committed atrocities
- Both sides are trapped in a cycle they can't escape
- Your intervention could save the city or doom it

### Campaign Connections

Shattar-Kai represents:
- **Microcosm of the larger conflict**: If you can't unite one city, how will you unite the multiverse?
- **Personal stakes**: Real people dying while cosmic forces manipulate events
- **Moral complexity**: No clean solutions, only hard choices
- **Ripple effects**: What happens here echoes through the campaign

**🎭 For Players**: Shattar-Kai will test your moral compass. There are no good choices, only less terrible ones. The question isn't "Can we stop the war?" but "Can we prevent it from destroying everything?"

{{< hint warning >}}
**⚠️ For DMs**: Make the war personal. Give NPCs names, families, dreams. When players have to choose who lives and dies, make it hurt. That's when the story matters most.
