# Grand Library (Bureau of Time and Plane Headquarters)
## Overview

The **Grand Library** serves as the beating heart of the **Bureau of Time and Plane**—a vast repository of knowledge, a command center for multiversal operations, and a place where only a select few ever step foot. Located within the **Astral Plane**, time flows differently here, and its inhabitants do not age in the conventional sense. The Library is not merely a place of books and scrolls; it is a fortress of thought, a nexus of information, and the operational hub of the Bureau's enigmatic work.

## General Information

- **Location:** Astral Plane
- **Purpose:** Headquarters of the Bureau of Time and Plane
- **Notable Features:** Infinite archives, teleportation nodes, spelljamming port, Bureau command chambers
- **Access:** Highly restricted; only Bureau agents, trusted contractors, and rare authorized visitors
- **Atmosphere:** A blend of quiet academia, high-security intelligence, and the hum of powerful magic

## Notable Features
### The Infinite Archives

The Library’s most famous section is its **Infinite Archives**, a labyrinthine collection of books, scrolls, and recorded memories. Some tomes predate mortal history, while others contain accounts from futures that have not yet come to pass. The archives are maintained by the **Pustakawan**, a division of scholars who ensure that no knowledge is lost or misused.

### Bureau Command Chambers

Deep within the Library lies the Bureau’s command center, where operatives receive assignments, conduct research, and discuss matters that could alter the fabric of time and reality. The Bureau's leadership—**Awanama**, **Pustakawan**, and veteran agents like **Shaperite**—can often be found here, debating the ethics of intervention.

### The Astral Port

A colossal docking bay extends from one section of the Library, allowing **spelljamming ships** to dock in controlled conditions. While Bureau agents primarily use teleportation, ships are necessary when subtlety is required or when dealing with planes that interfere with magic. The **port authority** ensures that only authorized vessels may land, screening all arrivals for security threats.

### The Maze of Echoes

A restricted sector hidden beneath the main halls, the **Maze of Echoes** is where classified information is kept, including failed timelines, forbidden knowledge, and dangerous artifacts retrieved by Bureau operatives. Only those with explicit clearance may enter, and even they are watched by unseen forces.

## Function and Culture

The Grand Library embodies both **scholarship** and **enforcement**. Agents of the Bureau are not mere record keepers; they are field operatives, investigators, and, when necessary, adjudicators of fate. The Library’s halls echo with whispered debates about multiversal ethics, the cost of intervention, and the true nature of **Ao’s Will**.

Despite its vastness, the Library maintains an air of quiet efficiency. Agents walk its halls in **distinctive robes**, their colors signifying their rank and role. While within the Library, formality is expected, but the agents also share an unspoken camaraderie—each knowing they operate in a realm few can comprehend.

## Known Inhabitants

- ****Awanama**** – The enigmatic leader of the Bureau, rarely seen but ever-present in decision-making.
- ****Pustakawan**** – The second-in-command, overseeing the Library’s knowledge management.
