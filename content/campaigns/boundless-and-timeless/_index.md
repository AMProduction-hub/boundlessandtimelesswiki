## Where It All Began

This campaign takes place in the **Forgotten Realms**, but unlike typical adventures focused on the Sword Coast, this story expands across the **planes themselves**—a true planescape adventure. The Material Plane is just the beginning. Your journey will take you through the cosmic architecture of reality itself.

### The Great Wheel of Cosmology

The world is not limited to the lands and seas you can see. Beyond the Material Plane lies a cosmic order known as **The Great Wheel Cosmology**. Each ring in this wheel represents a different world—where the laws of reality work differently than in the mortal realm.

Scholars believe that every belief and concept has a place in the cosmos:
- At its center lies **Sigil**, the *City of Doors*—a place without gods that serves as the nexus of all reality
- The **Outer Planes** house deities and cosmic beings
- The **Inner Planes** form the elemental building blocks of existence
- The **Ethereal Plane** and **Shadowfell** shadow the mortal world
- The **Astral Sea** connects all realities through endless void

But the eternal laws of the cosmos are beginning to waver. Something is moving, and no one knows if this is the beginning of destruction... or the birth of something new.

## Events That Shaped the World

These major events have shaken the foundation of Toril and beyond:

### The Blood War
> *"An eternal battle rages in the Lower Planes, but for the first time in recorded history, forces that should be sworn enemies now fight side by side. Why?"*

Devils and demons, locked in eternal conflict, have begun to cooperate. This unprecedented alliance signals something far more terrifying than their eternal war.

### The Time of Troubles
> *"The gods walked Toril as mortals, reshaping faith and power forever. But did Ao truly restore the balance, or did he prepare something even grander?"*

When gods walked the earth as mortals, the very nature of divine power was transformed. The ripples of this event still echo through the planes.

### The Fall of Angel Zariel and Elturel City
> *"A city once bathed in holy light fell into the depths of Hell. Many were saved, but the scars left behind tell of a bargain that could repeat itself."*

The holy city of Elturel was dragged into Avernus. Though heroes saved most of the city, the precedent has been set—even the righteous can fall.

### The Second Sundering
> *"Gods died, lands shifted, and magic was rewritten. But not all knowledge of the old world was lost—some remnants still lurk, waiting to be uncovered."*

Reality itself was rewritten. While much was restored, fragments of the old world remain, waiting to be discovered.

## Where You Come In

You are an adventurer. Perhaps you seek wealth, perhaps answers, or perhaps you've simply been caught in the currents of an unavoidable destiny. Whatever your reason, the world has changed.

Abyssal hordes appear in city corners. Whispers of dark pacts between Celestials and Infernals grow louder. Strange rifts tear through reality.

**The Material Plane is no longer just a witness to cosmic conflict—it has become the battlefield.**

The question is... will you be merely a pawn in a greater game, or will you become part of something larger?

## The Bureau's Calling

Not everyone catches the attention of **The Bureau of Time and Plane**. They don't recruit just anyone. Only those who have proven themselves—those who have carved their mark in the world's history—receive the opportunity to join.

**And you are one of them.**

Recently, in the **Northern Sword Coast**, your name has begun to be spoken. Perhaps you're a hero who saved a village from inevitable disaster. Perhaps you're a shadow hunter who exposed a conspiracy threatening major cities. Or perhaps you're simply an adventurer whose single action changed the course of fate.

Whatever your story, **your deeds have not gone unnoticed**.

Now, a calling has come. Whether through whispers in the night, a letter without a sender, or a mysterious figure waiting at a street corner—the message is the same:

*"The Bureau knows who you are. We have an offer for you. An opportunity that comes once in a lifetime."*

But this opportunity doesn't come without a price. By accepting this call, you will step into a conflict far greater than anything you've imagined.

Now, ask yourself: **What have you done to attract The Bureau's attention?**
