## Session Overview

The session opened directly at the train tracks cutting through a canyon near **Le Grant Kanyun**.

The party split:
- **Minerva, Sephire, Froggo** halted the train using the oil tank carriage
- **Asep and Verdian** took overwatch positions along the canyon rim

Combat erupted against **Baron Rail Guards**.  
Despite heavy cover and firearm lethality, the party successfully neutralized the guards and secured the train.

Inside the seventh carriage, the party discovered the true objective:
- **Baron’s Company Bonds**, tied directly to state power and legitimacy

Moments later, a massive dust cloud approached.

**Marshal Eliza Kane** arrived with an overwhelming posse (~40 riders).

Outnumbered, wounded, and cut off, the party fled into **Le Grant Kanyun**.

At dusk, deep within the canyon:
- The party encountered a **gravely wounded Red Jack**
- Moments later, a **wounded Marshal Kane** arrived

Words failed.

A three-way duel began:
- **Minerva**
- **Red Jack**
- **Marshal Eliza Kane**

Marshal Kane shot Red Jack dead.  
Before she could turn on Minerva, she was killed by a distant sniper.

The sniper revealed himself as **Angel Eye**, mounted and composed.

Red Jack’s revolver was empty.

Angel Eye refused further violence, stating:
> “Their time is over.”

He introduced himself only as **John**, then vanished deeper into the canyon.

The party buried Red Jack and Marshal Kane.  
Minerva took Red Jack’s hat and Kane’s Marshal star — and wore both.

## Key Learnings

- Victory and failure are sometimes indistinguishable
- Intervening does not mean owning the outcome
- Some conflicts end without closure — only survivors

## Who Did They Meet?

- **Red Jack** — Died in the canyon
- **Marshal Eliza Kane** — Died in the canyon
- **Angel Eye (John)** — Sniper, unaffiliated, unknowable

## Items Of Importance

- **Red Jack’s Hat**
- **Marshal Kane’s Star**
- **Professor Thinkwistle’s Components** (secured)

## What Worked

- The Mexican Standoff mechanic created genuine silence at the table
- No dialogue-heavy resolution increased emotional weight
- Players carried consequences forward without mechanical reward
