## Session Overview

The party returned to the **Grand Library Space Port**.

At a small container-shaped bar, a familiar **Dwarven Bartender** noted the unusual increase in field deployments and whispered rumors of Bureau interest in **Netherese artifacts**.

The party encountered ****Elira****, the Paladin’s daughter from the second artifact plane, now working junior requisitions.  
An awkward moment unfolded between Sephire, Asep, and Elira — unresolved, quietly human.

Attempted eavesdropping outside **Pustakawan’s office** ended abruptly when Verdian fell through the door.

Inside:
- **Shaperite** appeared altered — mechanical left arm, eyepatch, visibly changed
- The moment between Shaperite and Pustakawan never fully landed

During debrief:
- Pustakawan classified the Frontier Plane as **“resolved”**
- **Professor Thinkwistle** was officially ghosted
- Further involvement was deemed destabilizing

The party requested leave.
- Waterdeep was deemed unsafe due to Blood War spillover
- Sigil was quarantined by the Lady of Pain
- The party was granted rest within **Agent Dormitories**

Later, in the Library:
- The party researched **Ravenloft**
- Learned of **Count Strahd von Zarovich**, last recorded 400 years ago
- Discovered truths about **Vampire Spawn** and coffin-bound recovery

Finally, Pustakawan briefed the party:
- Two agents active: **ADAM** (local) and **HAWA** (external)
- Intelligence incomplete
- The party was instructed to trust their judgment

## Key Learnings

- The Bureau records outcomes, not experiences
- Rest does not mean recovery
- Trust will be tested — and information will be incomplete

## Who Did They Meet?

- **Pustakawan** — Liason, controlled, distant
- **Shaperite** — Changed, quiet, unresolved
- **Elira** — Junior agent, reminder of past consequences
- **Dwarven Bartender** — Witness to systemic escalation

## Items Of Importance

- Ravenloft archival texts
- Agent dossiers: **ADAM**, **HAWA**

## What Worked

- Low-action session allowed emotional decompression
- Bureau bureaucracy contrasted sharply with lived trauma
- Players reflected without being prompted mechanically
