# Table Etiquette & Expectations

These guidelines ensure everyone has a fun, respectful, and enjoyable experience at our table. All players are expected to follow these rules.

---

## 1. Punctuality & Attendance

**Be on time.** Sessions start at the agreed time and location (online or offline).

- **Grace Period**: 40 minutes after the scheduled start time
- **Quorum Rule**: If 3/4 of players are present, the session will begin immediately (even before the grace period ends)
- **Late Arrivals**: Players who arrive late may join the session in progress

{{< hint info >}}
**Why This Matters**: Starting on time respects everyone's schedule and maximizes our gaming time together.

## 2. Respect the Spotlight

**Don't interrupt other players** when they're speaking, roleplaying, or taking their turn.

- Wait for natural pauses before speaking
- If interruptions become frequent, the GM will implement a "speak when called upon" system
- Everyone deserves their moment in the spotlight

{{< hint warning >}}
**The Goal**: Everyone should feel heard and valued at the table.

## 3. Honor the Campaign Style

**Respect the type of campaign we're running.**

Different campaigns have different tones and expectations:
- Some are serious and dramatic
- Others are light-hearted and comedic
- Some focus on combat, others on roleplay

Match your play style to the campaign's tone, and be flexible with the GM's vision.

## 4. Respect Safety Tools & Boundaries

**Honor everyone's comfort levels.** We use Lines & Veils to ensure a safe space for all players.

### What Are Lines & Veils?

- **Lines**: Hard boundaries—content that will not appear in our game
- **Veils**: Soft boundaries—content that happens "off-screen" without detail

### Our Commitment
- Respect all Lines and Veils without question
- If something makes you uncomfortable, speak up
- The GM will address issues immediately and privately
- This applies to both online and offline sessions

**Remember**: A safe table is a fun table. Everyone's boundaries are valid.

## 5. Rules & Dispute Resolution

**The GM has final say on rulings.**

- The GM makes final decisions on rule interpretations
- Players may reference the rulebook to clarify rules
- However, the GM's ruling stands during the session
- Discussions about rules can happen after the session

{{< hint tip >}}
**At the Table**: Keep the game moving—trust the GM's ruling.  
**After the Session**: Discuss rules interpretations respectfully if needed.

## 6. Avoid Comparisons & Unsolicited Criticism

**Do not compare this game to other GMs or campaigns.**

Please avoid:
- Comparing to other GMs (professional or personal)
- Referencing "better" or "worse" games you've played
- Describing your "ideal GM" or "perfect game"
- Making negative comparisons during the session

### Providing Feedback
If you have constructive criticism or suggestions:
- **Communicate privately** with the GM (not at the table)
- Be respectful and specific
- Focus on actionable feedback
- Remember that GMing is challenging and everyone is learning

{{< hint warning >}}
**Why This Rule Exists**: Public comparisons undermine the GM's confidence and disrupt the game for everyone. Private, constructive feedback helps everyone improve.

## 7. Removal from the Table

**The GM reserves the right to ask a player to leave.**

If behavioral issues cannot be resolved through communication:
- The GM may ask a player to leave the table
- This decision will be made carefully and only when necessary
- The goal is always to maintain a positive experience for all players

{{< hint info >}}
**This is a last resort**, used only when other solutions have failed or when someone's behavior is severely disruptive.
