## Session Overview

The party arrived in the **Frontier Plane**, traveling through the dead woods of **Stormwood** — a forest scarred by lightning strikes, perpetual fog, and silence.  
They were guided to **Red Jack’s hideout**, a temporary base hidden deep within the forest.

The party was given time to rest extensively (16 hours total), burning through Hit Dice and preparing for a high-risk operation scheduled for the following midnight.

Red Jack briefed the party on the plan:
- An **oil tank carriage** had already been smuggled into a cave in **Le Grant Kanyun**
- The party’s task was to stop the Baron’s train using the carriage and secure its contents

The tone of the session emphasized inevitability — no speeches, no rallying cries, just preparation and quiet resolve.

## Key Learnings

- This plane operates on **violence as procedure**, not chaos
- Red Jack is not reckless — he is resigned
- Rest does not erase dread; it only delays it

## Who Did They Meet?

- **Red Jack** — Outlaw leader, visibly tired, quietly determined

## Items Of Importance

- **Oil Tank Carriage** — Volatile, central to stopping the train
- Maps of **Le Grant Kanyun** and surrounding rail lines

## What Worked

- Extended downtime increased tension instead of reducing it
- The environment reinforced the theme of “no clean exits”
- Players leaned into preparation and role separation
