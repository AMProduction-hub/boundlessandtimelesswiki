## WHAT THIS SESSION IS (FOR YOU, NOT THEM)

Session 23 is **not a mystery to solve**.  
It’s a **realization to arrive at**.

Your job is not to explain Barovia.  
Your job is to **let the players notice that the board reacts to them**.

---

## BEFORE THE SESSION (10–15 MIN PREP, MAX)

### 1. Physically prep the board (keep it simple)

You do **not** need art.

If you have:

- Sticky notes
- A marker 
- Yarn or string

You need **ONLY THESE 9 NOTES**:

Write them exactly like this:

1. **“Strahd Gone”**
2. **“Artificial Sun (Ritual)”**
3. **“Moon Anchors Stability”**
4. **“Registered Vampires”**
5. **“Unregistered = Terminated”**
6. **“Deep Purple Netherese Stone (Ravenloft)”**
7. **“Outsiders Arrived”**
8. **“Security Escalation”**
9. **“Civilian Casualties Increased”**

That’s it.

No dates. No lore walls.

---

### 2. Pre-connect ONLY THREE STRINGS

Do not overconnect.

- **Strahd Gone → Artificial Sun**
- **Artificial Sun → Moon Anchors Stability**
- **Outsiders Arrived → Security Escalation**

Leave the rest unconnected.

The _players_ do the rest.

## HOW TO RUN THE SESSION (STRUCTURE)

### OPENING (5 minutes)

You open with this, calmly:

> “HAWA’s safehouse is quiet.  
> Too quiet for a place that hasn’t slept in weeks.”

Describe:

- Board already set up
- Notes pinned
- Some strings added, some missing
- Coffee / cold tea / fatigue

Then say:

> “She doesn’t greet you at first.  
> She just steps aside and lets you look.”

**Stop talking.**

Let them approach the board.

---

### SCENE 1: PLAYER-LED CONNECTIONS (20–30 minutes)

This is crucial:  
**You do not explain. You answer questions.**

If they ask:

- “What’s this note?” → HAWA explains briefly, clinically
- “Why is this connected?” → HAWA answers factually, no judgment
- “Why isn’t this connected?” →  
    HAWA:

    > “Because I don’t know yet.”
    

Whenever a player makes a connection you like, **physically add string**.

Example:

- Player: “Wait… us arriving caused the escalation?”
- You quietly connect **Outsiders Arrived → Security Escalation**

Do **not** say “yes”.  
Let the string say it.

---

### SCENE 2: THE KNIFE (10 minutes)

When the board is mostly connected, HAWA says **one** of these lines (pick ONE):

Option A (gentle):

> “Before you came, this system only had to endure itself.”

Option B (neutral):

> “Power demands response. You brought power.”

Option C (sharp):

> “Stability doesn’t break from pressure.  
> It breaks from change.”

Then she adds **one last note** herself:

**“Hope Introduced”**

She pins it **between**:

- Outsiders Arrived
- Civilian Casualties Increased

She does not explain it.

---

### SCENE 3: LET THEM SIT IN IT (15–20 minutes)

This is where most DMs panic.

Don’t fill the silence.

If they argue:

- Let them  
    If they defend themselves:

- Let them  
    If they blame HAWA:

- She accepts it without denial

Her only defense is this:

> “Barovia survives.  
> That has always been my only metric.”

---

## WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO

- ❌ Do NOT introduce ADAM
- ❌ Do NOT reveal a “true villain”
- ❌ Do NOT offer a solution
- ❌ Do NOT push them toward Castle Ravenloft yet

This is a **thinking session**, not a quest hook.

---

## HOW TO END THE SESSION (CLEAN EXIT)

End with something actionable but non-combat:

HAWA says:

> “If you are going to change this place…  
> I need to know _how far_ you’re willing to go.”

Then give them **three options**, written on separate notes:

- **“Remove the Artifact”**
- **“Replace the System”**
- **“Leave Barovia Intact”**

Session ends there.

No dice.  
No fight.  
Just weight.

---

## LAST IMPORTANT THING (FOR YOU)

You’re tired because this arc is working.

If the players feel:

- Uneasy
- Defensive
- Quiet
- Thoughtful 

That is success.

You are not running a puzzle.  
You are staging a moral pressure cooker.

Get some rest.  
You already built the bomb — tomorrow you just let them hear it ticking.
