# Session 22 — **The Shape of Peace**

---

## Characters

**Sephire.** A paladin trained to hunt monsters, now facing a land where monsters follow rules — and breaking them has consequences.

**Minerva.** The lynchpin of the party, newly aware that her healing is not just power, but leverage in a land that counts survival carefully.

**Froggo.** Returned from death with sharpened instincts, increasingly aware of battlefield spacing and enemy spell threats.

**Verdian Suyanti.** Shaken but alive, beginning to see that presence and positioning matter as much as charm.

**Kairos.** Actively thinking in tactical terms — formations, roles, threat prioritization — for the first time.

**Asep.** Calculating, observant, and aware that systems — not individuals — keep this land intact.

---

## Strong Start

The Pequod pulls away from **Lake Zarovich** as the mist settles back into place.

No pursuit.  
No retaliation.  
No victory cheers.

Froggo and Verdian’s breaths return steadily — _too_ steadily — as Minerva’s magic finishes knitting flesh and soul back together. The revivals work. Cleanly. Almost _welcomingly_.

HAWA stands at the rail, watching the shoreline vanish.

After a long silence, she says:

> “You survived because you fought together.”  
> _(beat)_  
> “You nearly died because you fought instinctively.”

She turns to face the party.

> “Welcome to Barovia.”

## Scenes

- **Onboard the Pequod — After-Action Silence**  
    HAWA allows the party time to regroup, heal, and speak freely. She does not interrupt tactical discussions about formation, spacing, or spell targeting — she listens, approvingly.

- **Approach to Vallaki**  
    Vallaki comes into view under a pale, sustained sun. No screams. No thunder. Patrol routes are visible from afar — deliberate, patterned.

- **The Gates of Vallaki**  
    Entry is calm but procedural. Names are recorded. Affiliations noted. No weapons confiscated. The party is not treated as prisoners — but they are _noticed_.

- **First Walk Through the City**  
    Mortal and vampire citizens coexist in tense routine. Vampires wear sigils marking registration. Feeding is regulated. Guards do not threaten — they _observe_.

- **ADAM, Seen Clearly**  
    For the first time, ADAM does not hide. He watches from across a square as the party passes. When eyes meet, he inclines his head — acknowledgment, not hostility — then leaves.

## Secrets and Clues

- Revivification magic works **exceptionally well** in Barovia — death is regulated, not forbidden.
- The sun above Vallaki is sustained by ritual, not divine presence.
- The creatures fought at Lake Zarovich were **unregistered enforcers**, not random predators.
- No civilians have died in Vallaki for months.
- Vampires here do not hunt freely — rations and schedules are enforced.
- HAWA never calls vampires “citizens.”
- ADAM acts only _after_ HAWA has established policy.
- Castle Ravenloft still exerts influence, though indirectly.
- The mist reacts to holy symbols, not light.
- The land itself discourages chaos more than evil.

## Fantastic Locations

**Lake Zarovich**: quiet water, compliant mist, a place where conflict is noticed

**Vallaki**: orderly streets, careful coexistence, relief held under tension

**The Gate Square**: administrative calm, watchful guards, silent authority

**The Treeline**: dense, patient, observant — avoided even by patrols

---

## Important NPCs

**HAWA.** Selûnite cleric and Bureau agent. Believes peace must be enforced before it can be trusted.

**ADAM.** Silent executor of policy. Does not argue morality — only outcomes.

**Vallaki Gate Captain.** A mortal official who follows rules because breaking them once cost him everything.

**Registered Vampire Citizen.** Polite, reserved, and quietly terrified of disruption.
