## Characters 

**Sephire.** A paladin whose instincts are sharpened by absence — the expected evil is nowhere to be found, and that unsettles him more than open corruption.

**Minerva.** A watcher of patterns and cycles, quietly noting that Barovia feels curated rather than cursed.

**Froggo.** Alert, uneasy in forests that feel too maintained to be wild.

**Verdian Suyanti.** Enthralled by the aesthetic of the land, mistaking calm for safety — for now.

**Kairos.** Restless, suspicious of narratives that present themselves too cleanly.

**Asep.** Observing infrastructure, defenses, and logistics — noticing how much work it takes to keep this place “peaceful.”

## Strong Start 

The Pequod breaks the surface of **Lake Zarovich** under a pale, visible sun.

Not warm.  
Not cold.  
Present.

Mist clings to the waterline, but it parts as the ship settles. On the distant shore, **Vallaki stands intact**, banners fluttering in a light wind. No screams. No thunder. No looming silhouette moving across the clouds.

A woman stumbles from the treeline near the lake’s edge — cloak torn, breath ragged, moon-symbol glinting at her throat.

She looks at the ship, relief flickering across her face.

> “Thank Selûne,” she says.  
> “You’re real.”

This is **HAWA**.

## Scenes 

* **The Shore of Lake Zarovich**  
  HAWA gathers herself and thanks the party for arriving when they did. She speaks openly, calmly, and without urgency. She explains that Barovia has been *stable* — but stability requires vigilance.

* **The Walk to Vallaki**  
  The road is maintained. Waystones are intact. There are patrol markers — old, but used. HAWA points out vampire and mortal cooperation matter-of-factly, as if this is normal now.

* **First Night in Vallaki**  
  Taverns are open. People laugh — carefully. Vampires are present, clearly marked by sigils or badges denoting “Registered.” Tension exists, but violence does not.

* **ADAM Observed, Not Introduced**  
  The party notices a man watching from a distance — never approaching, never hiding. When confronted indirectly, he’s suddenly gone.

* **The Question of Strahd**  
  Eventually, someone asks.  
  HAWA answers simply:  
  > “Strahd von Zarovich is gone. Barovia survived him.”

She does not elaborate unless pressed.

## Secrets and Clues 

* The sun is **not natural** — it is sustained by ritual.
* Castle Ravenloft still exists, but no one goes there.
* Vampires here are not feeding freely — rations are enforced.
* Some villages are missing from local records.
* ADAM is not Barovian by birth, but he knows the land intimately.
* HAWA never refers to vampires as people — only as “entities” or “conditions.”
* The roads are safer than the forests.
* The mist retreats from holy symbols, not light.
* Vallaki’s leaders defer to HAWA even when she is absent.
* The lake has fewer fish than it should.

## Fantastic Locations 

**Lake Zarovich**: pale sunlight, mist that listens, water that reflects the wrong stars at night  

**Vallaki**: orderly, watchful, restrained relief  

**Old Svalich Road**: maintained stone, warded markers, quiet patrol paths  

**The Treeline**: dense, observant, avoided even by guards  

---

## Important NPCs 

**HAWA.** A Selûnite cleric who believes peace must be actively enforced. Calm, compassionate, and absolutely certain.

**ADAM.** A silent enforcer who never contradicts HAWA — only acts after she has spoken.

**Vallaki Burgomaster.** A local authority who governs in name, but not in practice.

**Registered Vampire (choose one).** Polite. Grateful. Tired.
