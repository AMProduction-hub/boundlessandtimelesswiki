# SESSION 20 — INTERMISSION

**Theme:** Aftermath, silence, unspoken divergence  
**Tone:** Quiet, procedural, heavy, restrained  
**Purpose:** Let the players *process*, not *progress*

---

## OPENING SCENE — RETURN TO THE GRAND LIBRARY

**Visual Tone**
- Endless shelves
- Dim astral light
- The Pequod docks without ceremony
- No applause, no urgency

**DM Read / Paraphrase**
> The portal closes behind you.  
> The Frontier is gone.  
> The Grand Library receives you the same way it always does —  
> as if nothing happened.

**Notes**
- No NPC greets them immediately
- Let players speak first if they want
- If silence happens, *let it*

---

## SCENE 1 — THE WALK

**Location:** Grand Library corridors  
**Purpose:** Re-entry without comfort

**Details to Drop In**
- Archivists passing by, eyes down
- A contractor with a missing limb being logged
- A clerk marking a death as “confirmed”

**Optional Prompt**
> You notice the smell of old paper again.  
> You didn’t realize you missed it.

**DM Intent**
- Normalize horror
- De-normalize the party’s experience

---

## SCENE 2 — OUTSIDE PUSTAKAWAN’S OFFICE

**Trigger:** Party arrives at the liaison office

**They Hear (Before Entering)**
- Low voices inside
- Shaperite and Pustakawan speaking

**Overheard Fragments (Choose 2–3)**
- “Mystra didn’t hesitate.”
- “You’ve gone quiet since then.”
- “This isn’t what we promised ourselves.”
- “Someone has to believe the system still works.”

### OPTIONAL MOMENT — THE KISS

If the party lingers:

**Description (Keep It Minimal)**
> There’s a pause.  
> A breath held too long.  
> Then a kiss — brief, restrained, final.

**DM NOTE**
- This is not romantic payoff
- This is **closure without resolution**
- Do not explain it

---

## SCENE 3 — DEBRIEF WITH PUSTAKAWAN

**Location:** Pustakawan’s Office  
**Atmosphere:** Clean, neutral, controlled

### Opening Line
> “Welcome back, Contractors.”

No “Are you alright?”

---

### DEBRIEF STRUCTURE

Pustakawan proceeds in **three phases**.

---

### PHASE 1 — FACTS

She asks for:
- Confirmation of artifact retrieval
- Status of local authority figures
- Casualty estimates (civilian / hostile)

**DM Tip**
- Ask players *who answers which question*
- Let discomfort emerge naturally

---

### PHASE 2 — EVALUATION

She notes:
- Mission success
- Acceptable losses
- Strategic outcome

**Line to Use**
> “The Bureau considers this operation… effective.”

Let that sit.

---

### PHASE 3 — THE QUESTION THAT MATTERS

She asks **one** of the following (pick based on table mood):

- “Would you make the same choices again?”
- “Do you believe the Frontier is better now?”
- “Did anyone hesitate?”

She does **not** comment on their answer.

She simply writes.

---

## SCENE 4 — SHAPERITE’S SILENCE

**Shaperite is present**
- Mechanical arm visible
- Eye patch worn plainly
- Calm, distant

**If addressed directly**
> “I’m still useful. That’s enough.”

**DM Intent**
- He is no longer asking permission
- He is already choosing another path

---

## SCENE 5 — THE BUREAU’S RESPONSE

**Pustakawan concludes**
> “Rest is advised.  
> Preparation will follow.”

No praise.  
No blame.

---

## SCENE 6 — PRIVATE MOMENTS (PLAYER-LED)

**Give the Table Space**

Prompt gently if needed:
- “Where does your character go after this?”
- “Who do they avoid?”
- “What do they keep with them?”

**Examples**
- Minerva holding the Marshal’s star
- Someone washing blood that isn’t there
- Someone not sleeping

Do not resolve these.

---

## SCENE 7 — THE NEXT FILE (TEASER ONLY)

**Pustakawan produces a thin file**

**Visible Markings**
- Artifact Color: **Deep Purple**
- Plane Classification: **Restricted / Social Instability**
- Agents Assigned: **ADAM**, **HAWA**

**Line**
> “Trust will be… central to this operation.”

She does not elaborate.

---

## ENDING IMAGE

**Final Description**
> The Library hums softly.  
> The universe continues.  
> And for the first time, no one tells you what it all meant.

**CUT TO BLACK**

---

## SESSION 20 SUCCESS CRITERIA

- No combat
- No dice-heavy mechanics
- Players talk more than NPCs
- Silence feels intentional, not awkward

If players leave quieter than they arrived —  
the session worked.
