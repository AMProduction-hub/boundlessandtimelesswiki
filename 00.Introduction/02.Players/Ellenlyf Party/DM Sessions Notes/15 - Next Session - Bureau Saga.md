## 🎯 Narrative Hook / Scene Opening  
The skies above flicker with infernal light. The armies of Stalwart launch their teleport-wizard assault on the Freemen camps even as the Freemen assault the Bastion’s outer walls.  
Damian’s voice cuts through the clamor: *“You must choose one side — we don’t have the hours for both.”*  
Eric and Sofia glare at each other, their love torn by war.  
A rift pulses at the center; you see Father Malen chanting, artifact glowing with wiring of infernal energy.

## 🧭 Goals & Stakes  
| Player Goals | Villain Goal | Battlefield Threats / Hazards |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Rally either/both factions | Fully manifest Zariel | Shadowflame rain, teleport surges, infighting, collapsing terrain |

## 🏰 Battlefield Setup / Zones  
- **Zone A — Bastion Gate**: walls, gate, ballistae, choke point  
- **Zone B — Freemen Camp**: tents, barricades, hidden paths  
- **Zone C — Ritual Grounds (center)**: open, artifact podium, magical lines  
- **Hazards**:  
  - Each round roll 1d6:  
    1–2: Shadowflame rain (DEX save)  
    3–4: Rift surge teleport random PC 10–20 ft  
    5–6: Infernal whispers (WIS save or compelled attack)  
  - Collapsing walls / rubble shift after Avatar arrival  

## 🔄 Act Flow / Phases  

### 1. **Battlefield Split**  
- Damian pressures a binary choice  
- NPCs argue: Eric pushes for Bastion, Sofia pushes for camp  
- Players may:  
  - Commit to one side  
  - Split forces or sneak between  
  - Use skill checks (Persuasion, Insight, Survival) to open both paths  
- Outcomes: determine which support arrives in final battle

### 2. **Ritual of the Artifact**  
- PCs reach central ground (or try to interrupt from distance)  
- Father Malen channels: 3 rounds minimum for ritual  
- Cultist waves spawn each round (CR ~4)  
- Shaperite & Musicians interfere: reduce progress by half  
- If PCs fail checks, ritual surges more strongly → environmental backlash  

### 3. **Avatar of Zariel Battle (Weakened)**  
- **Statblock** → (see below)  
- Each round: Musicians' temporal pulses act as “lair effects”  
- Faction support grants buffs / suppression support  
- If both factions present → allow “Hammer & Anvil” combo (Stalwart pins + Freemen flank → stun one major foe)  
- Curious moment: Zariel whispers to Sephire — temptation check  

### 4. **Aftermath & Fallout**  
- Avatar banished, rift collapses  
- Damage to battlefield, casualties, survivors  
- Eric & Sofia’s plea for peace  
- Damian’s reaction (controlled anger)  
- Reveal next arcs: Bureau’s interest, political fallout
