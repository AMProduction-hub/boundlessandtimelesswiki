These house rules enhance the core 5e experience by incorporating mechanics from Pathfinder 2e and other systems to create more dynamic gameplay.\nOverview#\rThis campaign uses modified rules to make characters more versatile and combat more strategic.

Have fun!\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/house-rules/table-manners/","title":"Table Manners","section":"GM 5e House Rules","content":"Table Etiquette \u0026amp; Expectations#\rThese guidelines ensure everyone has a fun, respectful, and enjoyable experience at our table. All players are expected to follow these rules.\n1. Punctuality \u0026amp; Attendance#\rBe on time. Sessions start at the agreed time and location (online or offline).\nGrace Period: 40 minutes after the scheduled start time Quorum Rule: If 3/4 of players are present, the session will begin immediately (even before the grace period ends) Late Arrivals: Players who arrive late may join the session in progress **Why This Matters**: Starting on time respects everyone's schedule and maximizes our gaming time together. 2. Respect the Spotlight#\rDon\u0026rsquo;t interrupt other players when they\u0026rsquo;re speaking, roleplaying, or taking their turn.\nWait for natural pauses before speaking If interruptions become frequent, the GM will implement a \u0026ldquo;speak when called upon\u0026rdquo; system Everyone deserves their moment in the spotlight **The Goal**: Everyone should feel heard and valued at the table. 3. Honor the Campaign Style#\rRespect the type of campaign we\u0026rsquo;re running.\nDifferent campaigns have different tones and expectations:\nSome are serious and dramatic Others are light-hearted and comedic Some focus on combat, others on roleplay Match your play style to the campaign\u0026rsquo;s tone, and be flexible with the GM\u0026rsquo;s vision.\n4. Respect Safety Tools \u0026amp; Boundaries#\rHonor everyone\u0026rsquo;s comfort levels. We use Lines \u0026amp; Veils to ensure a safe space for all players.\nWhat Are Lines \u0026amp; Veils?#\rLines: Hard boundaries—content that will not appear in our game Veils: Soft boundaries—content that happens \u0026ldquo;off-screen\u0026rdquo; without detail Our Commitment#\rRespect all Lines and Veils without question If something makes you uncomfortable, speak up The GM will address issues immediately and privately This applies to both online and offline sessions **Remember**: A safe table is a fun table. Everyone's boundaries are valid. 5. Rules \u0026amp; Dispute Resolution#\rThe GM has final say on rulings.\nThe GM makes final decisions on rule interpretations Players may reference the rulebook to clarify rules However, the GM\u0026rsquo;s ruling stands during the session Discussions about rules can happen after the session **At the Table**: Keep the game moving—trust the GM's ruling. **After the Session**: Discuss rules interpretations respectfully if needed. 6. Avoid Comparisons \u0026amp; Unsolicited Criticism#\rDo not compare this game to other GMs or campaigns.\nPlease avoid:\nComparing to other GMs (professional or personal) Referencing \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;worse\u0026rdquo; games you\u0026rsquo;ve played Describing your \u0026ldquo;ideal GM\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;perfect game\u0026rdquo; Making negative comparisons during the session Providing Feedback#\rIf you have constructive criticism or suggestions:\nCommunicate privately with the GM (not at the table) Be respectful and specific Focus on actionable feedback Remember that GMing is challenging and everyone is learning **Why This Rule Exists**: Public comparisons undermine the GM's confidence and disrupt the game for everyone. Private, constructive feedback helps everyone improve. 7. Removal from the Table#\rThe GM reserves the right to ask a player to leave.\nIf behavioral issues cannot be resolved through communication:\nThe GM may ask a player to leave the table This decision will be made carefully and only when necessary The goal is always to maintain a positive experience for all players **This is a last resort**, used only when other solutions have failed or when someone's behavior is severely disruptive. Summary: The Golden Rules#\r⏰ Be on time and ready to play 🎭 Let others have their moment — don\u0026rsquo;t interrupt 🎬 Match the campaign\u0026rsquo;s tone and style 🛡️ Respect everyone\u0026rsquo;s boundaries and safety tools 📖 Trust the GM\u0026rsquo;s rulings during play 🤐 Give feedback privately, not through comparisons 🤝 Work together to create a fun experience for everyone Questions or Concerns?#\rIf you have any questions about these guidelines, or if you\u0026rsquo;re experiencing issues at the table, please speak with the GM privately. We\u0026rsquo;re all here to have fun together!\n**Remember**: These rules exist to make the game better for everyone. Thank you for being a respectful and engaged player!

The Material Plane is just the beginning. Your journey will take you through the cosmic architecture of reality itself.\nThe Great Wheel of Cosmology#\rThe world is not limited to the lands and seas you can see. Beyond the Material Plane lies a cosmic order known as The Great Wheel Cosmology. Each ring in this wheel represents a different world—where the laws of reality work differently than in the mortal realm.\nScholars believe that every belief and concept has a place in the cosmos:\nAt its center lies Sigil, the City of Doors—a place without gods that serves as the nexus of all reality The Outer Planes house deities and cosmic beings The Inner Planes form the elemental building blocks of existence The Ethereal Plane and Shadowfell shadow the mortal world The Astral Sea connects all realities through endless void But the eternal laws of the cosmos are beginning to waver. Something is moving, and no one knows if this is the beginning of destruction\u0026hellip; or the birth of something new.\nEvents That Shaped the World#\rThese major events have shaken the foundation of Toril and beyond:\nThe Blood War#\r\u0026ldquo;An eternal battle rages in the Lower Planes, but for the first time in recorded history, forces that should be sworn enemies now fight side by side. Why?\u0026rdquo;\nDevils and demons, locked in eternal conflict, have begun to cooperate. This unprecedented alliance signals something far more terrifying than their eternal war.\nThe Time of Troubles#\r\u0026ldquo;The gods walked Toril as mortals, reshaping faith and power forever. But did Ao truly restore the balance, or did he prepare something even grander?\u0026rdquo;\nWhen gods walked the earth as mortals, the very nature of divine power was transformed. The ripples of this event still echo through the planes.\nThe Fall of Angel Zariel and Elturel City#\r\u0026ldquo;A city once bathed in holy light fell into the depths of Hell. Many were saved, but the scars left behind tell of a bargain that could repeat itself.\u0026rdquo;\nThe holy city of Elturel was dragged into Avernus. Though heroes saved most of the city, the precedent has been set—even the righteous can fall.\nThe Second Sundering#\r\u0026ldquo;Gods died, lands shifted, and magic was rewritten. But not all knowledge of the old world was lost—some remnants still lurk, waiting to be uncovered.\u0026rdquo;\nReality itself was rewritten. While much was restored, fragments of the old world remain, waiting to be discovered.\nWhere You Come In#\rYou are an adventurer. Perhaps you seek wealth, perhaps answers, or perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ve simply been caught in the currents of an unavoidable destiny. Whatever your reason, the world has changed.\nAbyssal hordes appear in city corners. Whispers of dark pacts between Celestials and Infernals grow louder. Strange rifts tear through reality.\nThe Material Plane is no longer just a witness to cosmic conflict—it has become the battlefield.\nThe question is\u0026hellip; will you be merely a pawn in a greater game, or will you become part of something larger?\nThe Bureau\u0026rsquo;s Calling#\rNot everyone catches the attention of The Bureau of Time and Plane. They don\u0026rsquo;t recruit just anyone. Only those who have proven themselves—those who have carved their mark in the world\u0026rsquo;s history—receive the opportunity to join.\nAnd you are one of them.\nRecently, in the Northern Sword Coast, your name has begun to be spoken. Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re a hero who saved a village from inevitable disaster. Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re a shadow hunter who exposed a conspiracy threatening major cities. Or perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re simply an adventurer whose single action changed the course of fate.\nWhatever your story, your deeds have not gone unnoticed.\nNow, a calling has come. Whether through whispers in the night, a letter without a sender, or a mysterious figure waiting at a street corner—the message is the same:\n\u0026ldquo;The Bureau knows who you are. We have an offer for you. An opportunity that comes once in a lifetime.\u0026rdquo;\nBut this opportunity doesn\u0026rsquo;t come without a price. By accepting this call, you will step into a conflict far greater than anything you\u0026rsquo;ve imagined.\nNow, ask yourself: What have you done to attract The Bureau\u0026rsquo;s attention?\nSword Coast Reference Map#\r(The Northern Sword Coast includes areas near Neverwinter, Luskan, and the surrounding regions. Use this map to develop your character\u0026rsquo;s backstory and heroic feats.)\nCampaign Information#\rParties#\rThis campaign follows two distinct parties experiencing different aspects of the multiversal crisis:\nC\u0026rsquo;est La Vie Party - ✅ Completed#\rSessions: 13 completed\nStatus: Campaign Concluded\nFocus: Bureau operations and planar investigations\nParty Members:\nGwyn Ashenka Roïs Meows Whiskerpop (Whisky) Jeno Klir Ellenlyf Party - 🟢 Active#\rSessions: 17 completed\nCurrent Arc: The Frontier (Bureau)\nStatus: Active\nParty Members:\nKairos Froggo Minerva Sephire Asep Verdian Suyanti Campaign Themes#\rCosmic Horror: Reality is fragile, and you\u0026rsquo;re seeing the cracks.\nMultiversal Scope: Your actions ripple across planes of existence.\nMystery \u0026amp; Investigation: Nothing is as it seems—question everything.\nHigh Stakes: The fate of reality itself hangs in the balance.\nPlayer Agency: Your choices genuinely matter in shaping the outcome.\nResources#\rSession Notes - Recaps and summaries by party Player Characters - Character sheets and backgrounds NPCs - Important characters you\u0026rsquo;ve met House Rules - Custom rules for this campaign **For Players**: This campaign uses modified 5e rules.

Which will you be?\u0026rdquo;\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/house-rules/character-advancement/","title":"Character Advancement","section":"GM 5e House Rules","content":"Character Advancement#\rIn standard D\u0026amp;D 5e, you must choose between an Ability Score Improvement (ASI) or a Feat every 4 levels. This house rule separates ASI and Feats, allowing you to gain both independently.\nAbility Score Improvements (ASI)#\rInstead of choosing between ASI and Feats, you now automatically receive +2 ASI every 4 levels, starting at level 2.\nASI Progression Table#\rLevel Ability Score Improvement 2 +2 points (can be split) 6 +2 points 10 +2 points 14 +2 points 18 +2 points How It Works#\rYou receive +2 points to distribute among your ability scores You can put both points into one ability (e.g., +2 Strength) Or split them between two abilities (e.g., +1 Strength, +1 Dexterity) Ability scores still cap at 20 (unless you have special features that increase this) **Example**: A level 6 Fighter with 16 Strength could increase it to 18, or increase Strength to 17 and Constitution to 15 (if it was 14). Feats#\rFeats are now gained separately from ASI, allowing you to customize your character without sacrificing ability score growth.\nFeat Progression Table#\rLevel Feats Gained 4 1 Feat 8 1 Feat 12 1 Feat 16 1 Feat 20 1 Feat Important Notes#\rFeats are gained based on total character level, not class level If you multiclass, you still gain feats at these levels You can choose any feat you qualify for (check prerequisites) Variant Human and Custom Lineage still get their bonus feat at level 1 **Multiclass Example**: If you're a Fighter 3/Wizard 1 (total level 4), you gain a feat at level 4, not when you reach Fighter 4. Combined Progression Example#\rHere\u0026rsquo;s what a character\u0026rsquo;s progression looks like through the first 8 levels:\nLevel ASI Feat Total Ability Improvements 1 — — Starting ability scores 2 +2 — Increased one or two abilities 3 — — — 4 — ✓ Gained first feat 5 — — — 6 +2 — Increased abilities again 7 — — — 8 — ✓ Gained second feat Why This Change?#\rThis house rule addresses several design issues in standard 5e:\nMore Customization: Players don\u0026rsquo;t have to choose between being effective (ASI) and being interesting (Feats) Better Balance: Martial classes benefit greatly from both ASI and Feats Faster Power Growth: Characters reach their optimal ability scores faster More Fun: Players get to explore more feat combinations **Strategic Tip**: Plan your ASI and Feat choices together! Some feats synergize well with specific ability scores. Remember: These improvements make characters more powerful, so expect tougher challenges!\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/campaigns/boundless-and-timeless/session-notes/","title":"Session Notes","section":"Boundless and Timeless","content":"Session Notes \u0026amp; Recaps#\rChronicle of adventures across the multiverse.\nParties#\rC\u0026rsquo;est La Vie Party - ✅ Completed#\rSessions: 13 completed\nStatus: Campaign Concluded\nLast Session: For The Ages and The New Beginning\nThe C\u0026rsquo;est La Vie party operated primarily in the Northern Sword Coast, investigating planar disturbances and conducting missions for The Bureau of Time and Plane.

This method:\nGuarantees meaningful damage on crits Still maintains variability with the rolled dice Makes critical hits feel impactful Armor Class Variants#\rIn addition to standard AC, this campaign uses Touch AC and Flat-Footed AC for certain situations.\nTouch Armor Class (Touch AC)#\rTouch AC represents how hard you are to touch, ignoring physical armor.\nTouch AC = 10 + Dexterity Modifier + Dodge/Deflection Bonuses + Size Modifier\n**Important**: Touch AC does NOT include armor bonuses or shield bonuses. When Touch AC Is Used#\rTouch AC is used for attacks that bypass physical armor:\nSpells that require a physical touch (Shocking Grasp, Chill Touch) Incorporeal touch attacks (ghosts, specters) Certain special abilities that ignore armor Calculating Touch AC#\rArmor Type Standard AC Touch AC Calculation Example Touch AC Unarmored (10 + DEX) 15 10 + DEX (+5) 15 Leather Armor (11 + DEX) 16 10 + DEX (+5) 15 Chain Mail (16) 16 10 + DEX (+0) 10 Plate Armor (18) 18 10 + DEX (+0) 10 Plate + Shield (20) 20 10 + DEX (+0) 10 Special Cases#\rMonk\u0026rsquo;s Unarmored Defense: Monks add their Wisdom modifier to Touch AC\nTouch AC = 10 + DEX + WIS + Dodge bonuses Barbarian\u0026rsquo;s Unarmored Defense: Barbarians do NOT add Constitution to Touch AC\nTouch AC = 10 + DEX + Dodge bonuses **Quick Rule**: If an attack specifically states it targets Touch AC, calculate it. Otherwise, use standard AC. Flat-Footed Armor Class (Flat-Footed AC)#\rFlat-Footed AC represents your defense when caught off-guard and unable to react.\nFlat-Footed AC = 10 + Armor Bonus + Shield Bonus + Size Modifier\n**Important**: Flat-Footed AC does NOT include Dexterity modifier or dodge bonuses. When Flat-Footed AC Is Used#\rYou use Flat-Footed AC when:\nYou are surprised at the start of combat You haven\u0026rsquo;t acted yet in the first round of combat You are restrained or paralyzed An attacker is hidden from you (Sneak Attack) You are unconscious or incapacitated Calculating Flat-Footed AC#\rArmor Type Standard AC Flat-Footed AC Calculation Example Flat-Footed AC Unarmored (10 + DEX) 15 10 only 10 Leather Armor (11 + DEX) 16 11 (base armor) 11 Chain Mail (16) 16 16 (armor only) 16 Plate Armor (18) 18 18 (armor only) 18 Plate + Shield (20) 20 18 + 2 (shield) 20 **Quick Rule**: Heavy armor users are relatively safe when Flat-Footed. Dexterity-based characters are vulnerable! Superiority Dice \u0026amp; Maneuvers#\rAll martial classes gain access to Superiority Dice and Maneuvers, giving them more tactical options in combat.\nSuperiority Die Overview#\rAll martial classes (Fighter, Barbarian, Ranger, Paladin, Rogue, Monk) gain Superiority Dice You start with 1 Superiority Die at level 3 Superiority Dice recharge on a short or long rest Battle Masters gain additional Superiority Dice as per their subclass Superiority Die Scaling#\rLevel Range Die Size 1–9 d6 10–16 d8 17+ d10 Maneuver Progression#\rYou learn maneuvers as you level up, gaining access to more powerful options at higher levels.\nManeuvers Known Table#\rLevel Maneuvers Known Tier Unlocked 3 2 Basic Maneuvers 5 3 Advanced Maneuvers 7 4 Tactical Maneuvers 9 5 Expert Maneuvers 11 6 Legendary Maneuvers 13 7 Legendary Maneuvers 15 8 Mythic Maneuvers 17 9 Mythic Maneuvers 19 10 Mythic Maneuvers **Battle Masters**: You gain extra Superiority Dice as normal for your subclass.

Parry (Level 10 Fighter with 1d8 Superiority Die, DEX +2)\nAn enemy hits you for 18 damage You use Parry as a reaction Roll 1d8 = 6, add DEX +2 = 8 total Reduce damage by 8: you take only 10 damage Strategic Tips#\rBuilding a Combat Style#\rAggressive Fighters: Focus on attack maneuvers (Precision Strike, Trip Attack, Sweeping Strike) Defensive Fighters: Focus on defensive maneuvers (Parry, Riposte, Unbreakable Will) Tactical Leaders: Focus on support maneuvers (Commanding Shout, Brace) Resource Management#\rYou only have 1 Superiority Die per short rest (unless you\u0026rsquo;re a Battle Master) Save it for crucial moments or use it early to gain advantage Consider multiclassing with Battle Master for more dice Synergy with Class Features#\rRogues: Use maneuvers to set up Sneak Attacks Paladins: Combine with Divine Smite for massive damage Barbarians: Use while Raging for even better effects **Remember**: Battle Masters get EXTRA Superiority Dice on top of this system, making them the ultimate masters of combat maneuvers!

Higher-tier creatures are more resistant to spells from lower-tier casters, while lower-tier creatures are more vulnerable to spells from higher-tier casters.\nTier Table#\rTier Character Level Creature CR Description Tier 1 1–4 CR ⅛ – CR 4 Local Heroes Tier 2 5–10 CR 5 – CR 10 Heroes of the Realms Tier 3 11–16 CR 11 – CR 16 Masters of the Realms Tier 4 17–20 CR 17+ Masters of the World **Your current tier determines your spell effectiveness** against enemies of different tiers. How Tiers Affect Spells#\rThe tier difference between caster and target affects spell strength in two ways:\nAgainst Higher-Tier Enemies (Weakened Effects)#\rWhen you cast a spell on an enemy whose tier is higher than yours:\nCrowd control spells have reduced effects Damage spells deal less damage on saves The enemy is more resistant overall Against Lower-Tier Enemies (Enhanced Effects)#\rWhen you cast a spell on an enemy whose tier is lower than yours:\nYour spells are more potent Save-or-suck effects last longer Damage can be dramatically increased Weakened Effects (Casting on Higher-Tier Enemies)#\rWhen casting spells on enemies of a higher tier, effects are reduced:\nSpell Type Weakened Effect Save-or-Suck (Paralysis, Polymorph, Banishment) Partial effect instead of full effect. Hold Monster only stuns for 1 turn, Polymorph reduces speed \u0026amp; AC instead of transforming, etc. Charm \u0026amp; Mind Control (Dominate, Suggestion, Fear) Target gets an extra save every round. Full effect only if they fail by 10 or more. Damage Spells (Fireball, Disintegrate) Target resists half damage if they save by 5 or more. Debuffs (Bane, Slow, Bestow Curse) Effects are halved (e.g., Slow only reduces movement, Bestow Curse lasts fewer rounds). Summoning (Conjure Animals, Planar Binding) Summoned creatures have fewer hit points or weaker stats. Control Spells (Wall of Force, Telekinesis) Target can interact with or resist more easily (e.g., a Tier 4 creature can break Wall of Force with an action). Healing \u0026amp; Buffs (Bless, Shield) No change unless a higher-tier creature is negating them (anti-magic field). Example: Tier 2 vs. Tier 3 Enemy#\rA Level 8 Sorcerer (Tier 2) casts Hold Person on a CR 15 Lich (Tier 3)\nNormal effect: Target is paralyzed Weakened effect: Lich loses its next bonus action instead of being paralyzed If the Lich fails by 10 or more, it gets the full paralyzed effect Enhanced Effects (Casting on Lower-Tier Enemies)#\rWhen casting spells on enemies of a lower tier, effects are empowered:\nSpell Type Enhanced Effect Save-or-Suck Spells If target fails by 10 or more, they suffer double duration or lose their next turn entirely. Charm \u0026amp; Mind Control No extra saves allowed. Full effect applies. Damage Spells On a failed save by 10 or more, damage doubles (like a critical hit). Debuffs No immunity. Effects that normally wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work on certain creatures now apply. Summoning Summoned creatures have bonus HP and attack rolls. Control Spells Spell\u0026rsquo;s range, duration, or area increases. Healing \u0026amp; Buffs Targets gain extra temporary HP or resistances. Example: Tier 4 vs. Tier 2 Enemy#\rA Level 18 Cleric (Tier 4) casts Banishment on a CR 9 Giant (Tier 2)\nNormal effect: Giant is banished for 1 minute (concentration) Enhanced effect: If Giant fails by 10 or more, it is banished permanently (no concentration needed) Tier Difference Mechanics#\rThe key mechanic is how much the target fails their save by:\nNormal Save (Fail by 1-4)#\rStandard spell effect applies No tier modifications Significant Fail (Fail by 5-9)#\rHigher-tier targets: Weakened effect applies Lower-tier targets: Standard effect, possibly extended duration Critical Fail (Fail by 10+)#\rHigher-tier targets: Full spell effect applies Lower-tier targets: Enhanced effect applies (double damage, extended duration, no saves) **Important**: The tier system applies to **enemies and bosses**, not to allies or willing targets! Practical Examples#\rExample 1: Tier 2 Wizard vs. Tier 3 Boss#\rLevel 6 Bard (Tier 2) casts Fear on a CR 20 Balor (Tier 4)\nThe Balor has advantage on the save (2 tiers higher) On a normal failure: Balor only loses its next reaction instead of fleeing On a critical failure (fail by 10+): Balor is frightened normally Example 2: Tier 3 Sorcerer vs. Tier 2 Enemy#\rLevel 16 Wizard (Tier 3) casts Fireball on a CR 6 Troll (Tier 2)\nTroll makes a DEX save: rolls 9, needs 15 to save (fails by 6) Normal damage: 8d6 fire damage Enhanced: Troll fails by less than 10, so takes normal damage If Troll had failed by 10+, it would take double damage (critical hit effect) Example 3: Tier 2 Cleric vs. Tier 4 Dragon#\rLevel 8 Cleric (Tier 2) casts Hold Monster on an Ancient Red Dragon (Tier 4)\nDragon makes a WIS save and fails by 3 Normal effect: Paralyzed Weakened effect: Dragon is only stunned until end of caster\u0026rsquo;s next turn Dragon cannot be fully paralyzed unless it fails by 10+ Example 4: Equal Tiers#\rLevel 12 Warlock (Tier 3) casts Dominate Person on a Mind Flayer (CR 13, Tier 3)\nBoth are Tier 3, so no tier modifications Spell works exactly as written in the rules Mind Flayer gets normal saves Why This System Exists#\rProblems It Solves#\rSave-or-Suck Spells: High-level bosses are no longer instantly defeated by a single failed save Challenge Scaling: Makes high-CR encounters feel appropriately challenging Strategic Casting: Casters must think tactically about which spells to use Power Fantasy: Lower-tier enemies are still easily controlled, maintaining the power fantasy Design Philosophy#\rBosses should be boss fights: They shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be trivialized by one spell Legendary Resistances are replaced: Instead of auto-succeeding, bosses get partial effects Progression feels meaningful: As you advance tiers, you become more powerful Strategic Considerations for Casters#\rAgainst Higher-Tier Enemies#\rFocus on damage spells instead of save-or-suck Use debuffs that don\u0026rsquo;t rely on saves (e.g., Magic Missile, Spiritual Weapon) Stack multiple effects to overwhelm their defenses Work with teammates to reduce saves (e.g., Bane, Cutting Words) Against Lower-Tier Enemies#\rSave-or-suck spells are powerful and reliable You can control entire groups with area-effect spells Single-target crowd control is extremely effective Feel free to be creative with your spell choices Equal-Tier Encounters#\rSpells work as written in the rulebook Standard 5e balance applies Use your best judgment and tactics Quick Reference Chart#\rYour Tier Enemy Tier Effect Lower Higher Your spells are weakened Equal Equal Standard 5e rules Higher Lower Your spells are enhanced Save Margin Matters#\rSave Result Against Higher Tier Against Lower Tier Fail by 1-4 Weakened effect Normal effect Fail by 5-9 Weakened effect Extended duration Fail by 10+ Full effect Enhanced effect GM Notes#\rBalancing Encounters#\rUse tier differences to make boss fights challenging without adding Legendary Resistances Lower-tier minions should feel easy to control Same-tier encounters play like standard 5e Adjudicating Partial Effects#\rWhen a spell has a weakened effect, use these guidelines:\nParalyzed → Stunned for 1 round Restrained → Speed reduced by half Charmed → Gets extra saves each round Transformed → Reduces stats instead (AC, speed, damage) Banished → Returns after 1 round instead of 1 minute **For Players**: Don't be discouraged when fighting higher-tier enemies! Your spells still matter—they just won't instantly win the fight. Work together and be strategic! This system preserves the fun of spellcasting while making high-level combat more strategic and exciting!\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/campaigns/archived/ye-cometh-arent-ye/","title":"Ye Cometh Aren't Ye","section":"Campaigns","content":"Ye Cometh Aren\u0026rsquo;t Ye#\rAn Unexpected Wacky Adventure#\rStatus: ✅ Completed\nSystem: D\u0026amp;D 5e\nTheme: Comedy, Unexpected Chaos\nCampaign Overview#\rWhat started as a simple adventure quickly devolved (or evolved?) into complete and glorious chaos.

Sebelum menjadi pengelana, Asep adalah salah satu war-seraph, malaikat perang buatan yang diciptakan oleh ilmuwan mortal untuk menjadi benteng ilahi di era keputusasaan. Ia dibesarkan bersama saudara kembarnya, Felix Quillon, oleh seorang ilmuwan wanita yang menjadi ibu mereka bernama Rem. Sang ilmuwan memperlakukan mereka bukan sebagai senjata, melainkan sebagai anak-anaknya sendiri — mengajarkan keduanya tentang nilai hidup, kasih sayang, dan makna kedamaian. Namun dunia di sekitar mereka justru semakin haus perang.\nWhat is your biggest regret or failure? Tragedi itu datang ketika Felix, yang sudah lama kecewa pada mortal, dalam kemarahan yang tidak terkendali tak sengaja membunuh ibunya yang berusaha melindungi mortal dan menghentikan Felix di depan Asep. Felix yang melihatnya terkejut dan lebih marah dari sebelumnya. Asep yang melihat itu, dalam ledakan emosi dan kemarahan, Asep kehilangan kendali atas kekuatannya. Ia mengamuk dan menghancurkan segalanya, membunuh sesama war-seraph dan mortal tanpa bisa menghentikan dirinya sendiri. Sejak hari itu, Asep bersumpah tidak akan pernah lagi menggunakan kekuatan untuk membunuh — bahkan jika itu berarti melawan takdirnya sendiri. Ia menyebut peristiwa itu sebagai “Hari Sayap Terbakar.”\nWhat is your greatest accomplishment? Bertahan hidup setelah kejatuhan bangsa war-seraph adalah keajaiban tersendiri. Asep bangkit dari reruntuhan, kehilangan sayap dan tujuannya, namun memilih untuk hidup — tidak lagi sebagai malaikat perang, tetapi sebagai pengrajin dan penyembuh. Dengan tubuh yang dipenuhi bekas luka logam dan sihir, ia sekarang menggunakan ilmu artificer dan wizardry untuk memperbaiki dunia, bukan menghancurkannya.\nCharacter Motivation (Why You Adventure)\nWhat do you seek? Asep mencari saudara kembarnya, Felix Quillon, yang kini memimpin sisa war-seraph sebagai dewa perang baru. Asep ingin membuktikan pada Felix — dan dirinya sendiri — bahwa kedamaian sejati dapat dicapai tanpa darah, bahwa kekuatan bukan hanya alat untuk membunuh. Ia tidak ingin membunuh Felix, melainkan menyelamatkannya dari kebencian yang dulu juga hampir memakan dirinya.\nWhat are you running from? Asep melarikan diri dari bayang-bayang masa lalunya — dari keputusasaan, dari rasa bersalah karena telah menjadi monster, dan dari takdir yang telah ditulis untuknya: menjadi senjata terakhir untuk mengakhiri Felix. Setiap malam, dalam mimpi, ia masih melihat wajah ibu mereka di antara kobaran api. Dan juga kabur dari bounty Hunter, dikarenakan dia terkena bounty akibat kekacauan yang dibuat saat di bumi hanya demi menyelematkan mortal (walaupun dalam kekacauan yang dibuatnya tidak ada korban jiwa\nWho or what do you hold dear? Yang paling ia jaga adalah kehidupan itu sendiri — entah itu manusia, elf, atau makhluk buatan. Ia juga masih menyimpan potongan sayap logam Felix, yang dia temukan di reruntuhan perang, sebagai pengingat: bahwa kasih dan kekerasan seringkali lahir dari tempat yang sama. Bagi Asep, itu adalah simbol harapan — harapan bahwa saudara yang hilang masih bisa diselamatkan.\nDo you have any allies or enemies?\nAsep memiliki dua figur penting dalam hidupnya yang paling memengaruhi jalan hidupnya:\nFelix Quillon, saudara kembarnya — sekaligus musuh terbesarnya. Keduanya diciptakan bersama sebagai War-Seraph twins, senjata hidup yang dirancang untuk menegakkan kehendak ilahi. Namun ketika perang suci pecah, Felix memilih jalan kekerasan demi membalaskan dendam kematian ibu angkat mereka, Rem, ilmuwan sekaligus ibu angkat penyayang yang pernah merawat kedua “anak” ciptaannya yang tak sengaja ia bunuh demi melindungi mortal, namun Felix menolak fakta itu, menyalahkan para mortal dan lanjut membantai mortal demi membalaskan kematian ibu nya Sejak saat itu, Asep bersumpah akan mencari Felix bukan untuk membunuhnya, tapi untuk membuktikan bahwa jalan belas kasih yang diajarkan Rem masih bisa menyelamatkan dunia — dan mungkin, saudaranya sendiri.\nRem, ibu angkat sekaligus ilmuwan yang dahulu menciptakan dan membesarkan Asep serta Felix. Ia bukan hanya ilmuwan, tapi juga sosok yang menanamkan empati dalam hati keduanya. Ia percaya bahwa makhluk buatan pun bisa memiliki jiwa dan kasih sayang. Namun, dalam perang terakhir, Rem tewas dibunuh oleh Felix, yang menganggap kasih sayangnya adalah bentuk kelemahan yang menghalangi evolusi mereka.\nAsep juga diburu oleh The Order of the Broken Halo, sekte rahasia yang memuja sisa-sisa War-Seraph sebagai utusan dewa baru. Bagi mereka, Asep adalah “yang tersisa dari langit,” sosok yang harus dipuja — sedangkan bagi Asep sendiri, mereka hanyalah cerminan gila dari perang lama yang ingin ia lupakan.\nWhat is your relationship with the Bureau of Time and Plane?\nSetelah menyelamatkan warga dari ledakan arcane core di distrik utara Neverwinter tanpa membunuh siapa pun, Asep menarik perhatian Bureau of Arcane Stability (BAS). Awalnya, ia dianggap ancaman — entitas magitek tak dikenal. Namun, setelah melihatnya menstabilkan reaktor magitek dengan mengorbankan sebagian energi inti tubuhnya, Bureau akhirnya merekrutnya sebagai penasihat teknis lapangan.\nDalam laporan resmi, insiden itu dikenal sebagai “The Lumina Core Incident.” Sejak saat itu, Asep diizinkan beroperasi bersama agen-agen Bureau untuk menangani ancaman yang berhubungan dengan teknologi Netheril atau sisa peninggalan perang surgawi.\nMeski begitu, Bureau tidak tahu kebenaran: bahwa Asep adalah makhluk ilahi buatan yang seharusnya sudah punah. Di mata mereka, dia hanyalah orc penyendiri dengan senyum konyol dan kemampuan mekanik yang luar biasa.\nWhat do you think of the gods?\nAsep tidak membenci para dewa, tetapi juga tidak lagi mempercayai mereka. Menurutnya, mereka sama saja seperti para jenderal perang yang dulu menciptakan dirinya — memerintah dari atas, membiarkan makhluk di bawah mereka saling menghancurkan.\nNamun kenangan tentang Rem, yang selalu mengajarinya untuk memahami kasih dan kehidupan, membuatnya tetap menghormati nilai-nilai ilahi tanpa harus menyembah para dewa. Baginya, cinta dan empati adalah bentuk ibadah tertinggi.\nDalam percakapan santai, Asep sering berkata sambil tersenyum getir:\n“Rem dulu bilang, dewa nggak suka turun tangan karena takut ikut berdosa. Aku rasa mereka cuma takut kotorin tangan mereka sendiri. Tapi ya… mungkin mereka juga capek sama perang.”\nClass Table#\rArtificer#\rSource: Tasha\u0026rsquo;s Cauldron of Everything p. 9, Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 54\nSpell Slots per Spell Level "},{"id":18,"href":"/campaigns/boundless-and-timeless/player-characters/ashenka-rois/","title":"Ashenka Rois","section":"Player Characters","content":"Ashenka Roïs#\rOverview#\rBasic Background#\rAn orphaned girl dedicating her life for the Monastery—until she finds out, one day, through a mysterious letter that beckoned her to leave and search for the sender: her Father, whom she thought was long dead, sent for her.

Born with the soft, woolly features of a sheep—curled horns, fleece-like hair on her ears and shoulders—and the upright stature of a human, Elara stands out with her striking white hair that cascades like fresh snow and dark, earthy skin that hints at her deep connection to the forests. Her eyes are a gentle amber, often wide with curiosity or sorrow, reflecting her empathetic nature.\nFrom a young age, Eva was drawn to the healing arts, spending hours foraging for rare herbs and studying ancient remedies under her family\u0026rsquo;s guidance. She is inherently compassionate and intuitive, with a spiritual devotion to Sheela, the goddess of Nature. However, after a devastating mistake, Eva\u0026rsquo;s once-warm personality became overshadowed by guilt and obsession, turning her into a reclusive figure who roams the forests, seeking out the injured with an almost frantic intensity. Eva\u0026rsquo;s primary motivation stems from overwhelming guilt over a tragic accident where her error as a healer led to the deaths of several children. This event shattered her self-image and deepened her devotion to Sheela, whom she sees as both a source of forgiveness and a judge of her worth.\nShe believes that by healing every injured or broken thing she encounters, she can atone for her mistake and earn Sheela\u0026rsquo;s mercy. She aims to heal as many beings as possible, from wounded animals to damaged plants, viewing each act as a step toward erasing her past sin. However, this drive has become obsessive, blurring the line between healing and compulsion, as she prioritizes her mission over her own well-being or relationships.

Sesampainya di House of Fisher Calyan dan Party membakar habis House of Fisher karena; 1. Mereka melanggar perjanjian mereka dengan [[Fremen]] 2. Dilakukan pembakaran ini untuk melindungi sumber daya alam. Kemudian mereka pun melanjutkan perjalanan ke No Man\u0026rsquo;s Land dimana disana ada Secret Base milik [[Fremen]]. Sementara itu [[Kairos]] \u0026amp; [[Froggo]] yang sudah sampai di House of Silence mereka bergegas mencari informasi tentang batu artifact dan menemukan buku yang menuliskan sejarah Shattar-Kai yang dimulai dari kumpulan koloni-koloni dan menunjukkan kalau kapal pemimpin koloni yang membawa artifact terjatuh dan membuat yang sekarang dinamai Tunnel of Grim.

[[Verdian Suyanti]] mencoba menenangkan situasi, namun sebuah tembakan dilepaskan dan nyaris mengenai kakinya.\n[[Minerva]] lalu menyebutkan bahwa mereka sedang mencari [[Red Jack The Showman]], dan pemimpin geng itu menjawab bahwa mereka adalah “teman” Red Jack, serta mengatakan bahwa ia ada di Saloon. Pertemuan pun berakhir damai dan Party menuju Saloon.\nSaat masuk ke dalam Saloon, suasana ramai mendadak hening melihat Party. Mereka menuju Bartender untuk bertukar informasi. Party mengetahui bahwa [[Red Jack The Showman]] sedang bermain kartu — dan tradisi The Frontier melarang siapapun mengganggu pemain kartu — jadi Party menghabiskan waktu dengan berinteraksi di sekitar Saloon.\n[[Minerva]] menjual satu kantong [[goodberry|Goodberry]] (20 buah) kepada Bartender seharga 20 cent dan 3 minuman terbaik di sana. Setelah meneguk minumannya, Party menjadi teler dan berjalan-jalan.\n[[Froggo]] mencoba menggunakan [[pass-without-trace|Pass without Trace]] di plane tanpa sihir — ia terkejut karena sihir itu berhasil. Ia segera melipir berkeliling seperti sedang bersembunyi.\nSementara itu [[Minerva]] dan [[Sephire]] mencari air di area parkir kuda. Ketika [[Minerva]] mengangkat [[Sephire]] dan menyandarkannya pada seekor kuda, kemudian melemparkan isi palung air ke arahnya, kuda yang berada di belakang [[Sephire]] terkejut dan menendangnya lalu kabur keluar kota.\nSetelah situasi tenang kembali, permainan kartu [[Red Jack The Showman]] hanya menyisakan dirinya dan satu orang. Party menghampiri, orang tersebut bersalaman dengan Jack lalu pergi.\n[[Red Jack The Showman]] mempersilakan Party duduk. Ia mendengarkan kebutuhan Party (Genset, Dinamo, Kabel Tembaga) dan mengatakan ia tahu di mana barang-barang itu berada. Namun ia memperingatkan:\n“Jangan sampai ada yang tahu kalian dapat informasi ini dariku. Jika bocor… aku pasti tahu siapa yang membocorkannya.”\nJack menjelaskan bahwa kereta milik [[Baron Blackthorn]] membawa banyak barang berharga, dan ia serta gengnya berencana “memerdekakan” barang-barang itu. Ia menawarkan kerja sama kepada Party dan meminta mereka menemuinya di Stormwood besok malam.\nIa memberikan 2 [[revolver|Revolver]] kepada [[Minerva]] dan [[Froggo]], 1 Double Barrel [[shotgun|Shotgun]] kepada [[Sephire]], serta 20 Dollar untuk membeli pakaian yang sesuai. Ketika Red Jack keluar dari Saloon, terdengar seseorang meneriakkan:\n“KEMANA KUDAKU?!?!”\nParty keluar dengan sikap santai, kemudian pergi membeli pakaian dan menukarkan emas dengan Dollar melalui seorang “Orang Aneh Ye Olde Town” yang meminum botol bertuliskan “XXX”.\nKetika Party selesai berganti pakaian, mereka didatangi oleh [[Marshal Eliza Kane]], pelindung Ye Olde Town. Party menanyakan barang yang dicari [[Professor Thinkwistle]], dan Marshal menyanggupi bahwa ia bisa memberikannya — jika Party membantu melindungi kereta [[Baron Blackthorn]], yang menurut informasinya akan dirampok. Kereta itu menuju tambang emas besar milik sang Baron.\nJika Party tertarik, [[Marshal Eliza Kane]] akan menunggu di Menara Jam besok siang.\nParty pun merencanakan untuk bermain dua sisi: bekerja sama dengan Red Jack sekaligus Marshal Eliza. Namun mereka memutuskan untuk mandi dulu di Bathhouse.\nDi Bathhouse, [[Froggo]] mendengar percakapan bahwa geng [[Red Jack The Showman]] berhasil mencuri tanki oli dan akan menggunakannya untuk merampok kereta. Ia menunggu sampai orang itu keluar dan melihat seorang pria bertopi hitam, berpakaian gelap, membawa [[revolver|Revolver]] dengan gagang ivory.\nSetelah mandi, [[Froggo]] menyampaikan informasi tersebut. Party menutup hari dengan menyewa kamar di Inn dan berdiskusi tentang rencana besok.\nKey Learnings#\r[[Professor Thinkwistle]] membutuhkan Genset (Generator), Dinamo, Kabel Tembaga. [[Red Jack The Showman]] dan 6 Orang Gang nya akan merampok kereta milik [[Baron Blackthorn]]. [[Marshal Eliza Kane]] berencana melindungi kereta milik [[Baron Blackthorn]].

Frontier Plane, traveling through the dead woods of Stormwood — a forest scarred by lightning strikes, perpetual fog, and silence.\nThey were guided to Red Jack’s hideout, a temporary base hidden deep within the forest.\nThe party was given time to rest extensively (16 hours total), burning through Hit Dice and preparing for a high-risk operation scheduled for the following midnight.\nRed Jack briefed the party on the plan:\nAn oil tank carriage had already been smuggled into a cave in Le Grant Kanyun The party’s task was to stop the Baron’s train using the carriage and secure its contents The tone of the session emphasized inevitability — no speeches, no rallying cries, just preparation and quiet resolve.\nKey Learnings#\rThis plane operates on violence as procedure, not chaos Red Jack is not reckless — he is resigned Rest does not erase dread; it only delays it Who Did They Meet?#\rRed Jack — Outlaw leader, visibly tired, quietly determined Items Of Importance#\rOil Tank Carriage — Volatile, central to stopping the train Maps of Le Grant Kanyun and surrounding rail lines What Worked#\rExtended downtime increased tension instead of reducing it The environment reinforced the theme of “no clean exits” Players leaned into preparation and role separation "},{"id":60,"href":"/campaigns/boundless-and-timeless/session-notes/ellenlyf-party/19---the-standoff-of-centuries/","title":"19

[[wizard-bladesinging-tce|Bladesinging]] [[wizard|Wizard]] Session Overview#\rThe session opened directly at the train tracks cutting through a canyon near Le Grant Kanyun.\nThe party split:\nMinerva, Sephire, Froggo halted the train using the oil tank carriage Asep and Verdian took overwatch positions along the canyon rim Combat erupted against Baron Rail Guards.\nDespite heavy cover and firearm lethality, the party successfully neutralized the guards and secured the train.\nInside the seventh carriage, the party discovered the true objective:\nBaron’s Company Bonds, tied directly to state power and legitimacy Moments later, a massive dust cloud approached.\nMarshal Eliza Kane arrived with an overwhelming posse (~40 riders).\nOutnumbered, wounded, and cut off, the party fled into Le Grant Kanyun.\nAt dusk, deep within the canyon:\nThe party encountered a gravely wounded Red Jack Moments later, a wounded Marshal Kane arrived Words failed.\nA three-way duel began:\nMinerva Red Jack Marshal Eliza Kane Marshal Kane shot Red Jack dead.\nBefore she could turn on Minerva, she was killed by a distant sniper.\nThe sniper revealed himself as Angel Eye, mounted and composed.\nRed Jack’s revolver was empty.\nAngel Eye refused further violence, stating:\n“Their time is over.”\nHe introduced himself only as John, then vanished deeper into the canyon.\nThe party buried Red Jack and Marshal Kane.\nMinerva took Red Jack’s hat and Kane’s Marshal star — and wore both.\nKey Learnings#\rVictory and failure are sometimes indistinguishable Intervening does not mean owning the outcome Some conflicts end without closure — only survivors Who Did They Meet?#\rRed Jack — Died in the canyon Marshal Eliza Kane — Died in the canyon Angel Eye (John) — Sniper, unaffiliated, unknowable Items Of Importance#\rRed Jack’s Hat Marshal Kane’s Star Professor Thinkwistle’s Components (secured) What Worked#\rThe Mexican Standoff mechanic created genuine silence at the table No dialogue-heavy resolution increased emotional weight Players carried consequences forward without mechanical reward

Grand Library Space Port.\nAt a small container-shaped bar, a familiar Dwarven Bartender noted the unusual increase in field deployments and whispered rumors of Bureau interest in Netherese artifacts.\nThe party encountered [[Elira]], the Paladin’s daughter from the second artifact plane, now working junior requisitions.\nAn awkward moment unfolded between Sephire, Asep, and Elira — unresolved, quietly human.\nAttempted eavesdropping outside Pustakawan’s office ended abruptly when Verdian fell through the door.\nInside:\nShaperite appeared altered — mechanical left arm, eyepatch, visibly changed The moment between Shaperite and Pustakawan never fully landed During debrief:\nPustakawan classified the Frontier Plane as “resolved” Professor Thinkwistle was officially ghosted Further involvement was deemed destabilizing The party requested leave.\nWaterdeep was deemed unsafe due to Blood War spillover Sigil was quarantined by the Lady of Pain The party was granted rest within Agent Dormitories Later, in the Library:\nThe party researched Ravenloft Learned of Count Strahd von Zarovich, last recorded 400 years ago Discovered truths about Vampire Spawn and coffin-bound recovery Finally, Pustakawan briefed the party:\nTwo agents active: ADAM (local) and HAWA (external) Intelligence incomplete The party was instructed to trust their judgment Key Learnings#\rThe Bureau

Changed, quiet, unresolved Elira — Junior agent, reminder of past consequences Dwarven Bartender — Witness to systemic escalation Items Of Importance#\rRavenloft archival texts Agent dossiers: ADAM,
