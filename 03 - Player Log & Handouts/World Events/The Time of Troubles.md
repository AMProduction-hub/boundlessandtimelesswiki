# **[[The Time of Troubles]]**

> _"The sky wept fire, and the gods bled upon the earth. Mortals, once mere spectators, became the hands that shaped divinity itself."_

Once, the gods were untouchable, seated high upon their celestial thrones. Then, one fateful day, they fell.

It began with **Bane and Myrkul**, gods of tyranny and death, who stole the **Tablets of Fate**, divine records that kept the cosmos in balance. In his fury, **Ao, the Overgod**, cast every deity from the heavens, trapping them in mortal flesh.

- **Mystra, goddess of magic, was slain**, causing magic to spiral into chaos.
- **Bane, Myrkul, and other dark gods waged war openly**, using their mortal avatars to fight.
- **Torm, the loyal knight-god, sacrificed himself to stop Bane**, but both perished.
- **The dead walked, kingdoms crumbled, and prayers went unanswered.**

When the Tablets were finally returned, Ao **restored the gods**—but **with new rules**:

- Gods could no longer exist **without mortal worship**.
- Divinity was no longer absolute—if enough people lost faith, **a god could die**.
- **The Bureau of Time and Plane** was created shortly after to ensure **this never happened again**.
