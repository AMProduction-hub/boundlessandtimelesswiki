*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet

- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `3d8` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
