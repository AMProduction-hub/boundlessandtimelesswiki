# Mind Blank
*8th-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the [charmed](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition. The spell even foils [wish](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target's mind or to gain information about the target.
