# Ray of Frost
*cantrip, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes `1d8` cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

The spell's damage increases by `1d8` when you reach 5th level (`2d8`), 11th level (`3d8`), and 17th level (`4d8`).
