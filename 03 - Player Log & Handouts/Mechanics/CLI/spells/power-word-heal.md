# Power Word Heal
*9th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is [charmed](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), [frightened](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [paralyzed](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), or [stunned](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned), the condition ends. If the creature is [prone](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone), it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**Classes**: [Cleric](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Bard](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE")
