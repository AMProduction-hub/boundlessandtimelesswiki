Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall [prone](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall [prone](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).
