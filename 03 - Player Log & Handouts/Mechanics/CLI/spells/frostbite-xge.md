# Frostbite
*cantrip, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `1d6` cold damage, and it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by `1d6` when you reach 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
