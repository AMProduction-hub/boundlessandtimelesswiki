# [Domovoi](03 - Player Log & Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\fey/domovoi-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 108*  

*The creature resembles a large, stony goblin, with an oversized head and leering grin. It has a mossy beard, massive shoulders, and long forearms.*

## Abandoned Servants

The domovoi were the portal guards and house lackeys of the elvish nobility, and when elves leave a place, the domovoi are often left behind. Some say the domovoi are left on purpose, while others say the domovoi are too attached to their homes to follow the elves to far-flung locales.

## Debt Collectors

These smirking stragglers seek work as tireless sentinels and fey button men, collecting debts for criminal syndicates. They delight in frustrating the progress of would-be thieves and tomb robbers, and they enjoy roughing up weaker creatures with their powerful, stony fists.

> [!note] Domovoi in Midgard
> 
> The domovoi are ancient survivors, and they have outlived empires. They now have a certain sense of ownership of ancient places. They most commonly dwell in the ruins of Old Valera and Old Thorn, as well as the vast necropoli of Spintarra and Siwal. The Siwalese Fey are sandier in appearance and have beards of rope and twine. These desert domovoi are known as "pa'athara" in Siwalese.
