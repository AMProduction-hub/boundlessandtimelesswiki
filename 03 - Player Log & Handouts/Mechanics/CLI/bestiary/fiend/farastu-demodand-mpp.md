# [Farastu Demodand](03 - Player Log & Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\fiend/farastu-demodand-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 26, Sigil and the Outlands*  

Farastus, also known as tarry demodands, are the least of the demodands. These violent Fiends ooze thick, sticky tar that sticks to anything it touches. Arrogant and cruel, farastus delight in tormenting those weaker than themselves. Due to their sharp senses and vicious streaks, farastus sometimes work as hunters that track down those who escape Carceri.

## Demodands

Demodands, also called gehreleths, are Fiends from the Tarterian Depths of Carceri. Cast into the prison plane long ago for forgotten transgressions, these bitter, wicked creatures have appointed themselves the jailers of the plane. Demodands viciously defend the few known portals that lead out of Carceri and ruthlessly torment other creatures trapped there.

Demodands that manage to leave Carceri know they're doomed to return; a demodand that dies outside Carceri re-forms there in a torturous process that takes `2d20` days. Even those who survive on other planes find themselves eventually dragged back, pulled by some planar tether.
