# [Reigar](03 - Player Log & Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\celestial/reigar-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 47, Light of Xaryxis*  

Reigar were once cephalopods similar to octopi. They inhabited the stormy seas of Ysgard until the gods of that plane transformed them. They have bioluminescent freckles and the ability to change the coloration of their skin. A glory (or halo) surrounds each of them. This magical display is a cloud of twinkling, glittering motes that changes color randomly and repels attacks.

Gifted with audacious hearts, reigar emerged from the Ysgardian seas to test their mettle on land. When the endless battles there grew tiresome, some reigar ventured to the Astral Sea and Wildspace in search of glory. Many are driven by artistic pursuits, but each reigar has their own notion of what constitutes art. For some, warfare is the highest form of artistic endeavor. Other reigar create art of a more benign nature.

Reigar wander Wildspace and the Astral Sea in search of artistic inspiration, traveling in symbiotic organic ships that they create (see "Esthetic"). Each reigar possesses a magic item called a talarith, which the reigar created and to which they alone can attune. If this object is lost or destroyed, it takes `1d10 + 20` days for the reigar to craft another one.
