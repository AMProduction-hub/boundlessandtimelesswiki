# [Emerald Order Cult Leader](03 - Player Log & Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/emerald-order-cult-leader-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 410*  

The Emerald Order cult leader has embraced the mysteries of the Emerald Tablet and has bent its worship of Thoth-Hermes to furthering the efforts of the Order. The cult leader seeks to gather arcane and alchemical knowledge wherever it is found by any means necessary. If subtle manipulations fail, the cult leader is not above using lethal methods to ensure the cult's goals are met.
