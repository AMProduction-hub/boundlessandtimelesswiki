# More Difficult Identification
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 136* 

If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, consider removing the ability to identify the properties of a magic item during a short rest, and require the [identify](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify.md) spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a magic item does.
