# Drow High Magic
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  
**Prerequisite**: [Elf (Drow)](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/races/elf-drow.md)
You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the [detect magic](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn [levitate](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/levitate.md) and [dispel magic](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
