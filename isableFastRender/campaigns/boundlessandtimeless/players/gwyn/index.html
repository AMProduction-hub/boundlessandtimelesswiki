<p><strong>Who?</strong>
Gwyn, a variant human. Formerly an acolyte in a little village, left his temple became a paladin after seeing a very beautiful envoy from a foreign land. Unfortunately, he was so low in position he couldn&rsquo;t even inquire the identity of this person, or if that&rsquo;s even a mortal at all. He is now in an unending search to find this beauty that once stole his heart. His point of view has become twisted, often seeing beauty in everything, even the most mundane or vile of things.</p>
<p><strong>Where?</strong>
He hailed from Temple of the Morninglight, a quiet monastery nestled in the hills south of Amn. Amn is a powerful and wealthy nation in the southwestern part of Faerûn, along the Sword Coast. Merchants and nobles often send their children here to learn the value of restrain.</p>
<p><strong>What do you look like?</strong>
Gwyn is a Paladin in a rose-colored armor, or &ldquo;Love-colored&rdquo;, in his own words. His flowing silver locks is natural, and heavily cared for during his spare time. He acts with utmost elegance and respect, even to the lowest of bandits. Desecrating anything he sees as beauty, however, is a surefire way to earn his contempt.</p>
<p><strong>What was your life before?</strong>
An Acolyte turned into a Paladin of Ancient Oath. He goes on missions assigned by his superiors until the story starts.</p>
<p><strong>Biggest regret?</strong>
Not being able to find out the identity of the mysterious beauty who set him towards this knightly path.</p>
<p><strong>Greatest accomplishment?</strong>
Turning a group of bandits into law-abiding citizens after sparing them and showing the path to righteousness. Those people are now merchants in Amn.</p>
<p><strong>What do you seek?</strong>
To find the mysterious beauty, and bask in the more beautiful part of this world he has yet to explore.</p>
<p><strong>What are you running from?</strong>
Regret form lives he couldn&rsquo;t save or turn to the righteous path.</p>
<p><strong>What do you hold dear?</strong>
The memory of the mysterious beauty, and the ideal of beauty.</p>
