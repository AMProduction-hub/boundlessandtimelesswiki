# Friends and Foes
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos, p. 183* 

This chapter provides more than forty monsters and NPCs who live in and around Strixhaven. They appear in this book's adventures, and you're free to use them in adventures of your own creation, whether those tales are set in the university or elsewhere in the D&D multiverse.

The creatures in this bestiary are organized alphabetically. A few creatures are gathered under a group heading; for example, the ""Lorehold Scholars"" section contains stat blocks for faculty and students of Lorehold, and those stat blocks are presented alphabetically within that section.

The Strixhaven Creatures table below lists every creature in this chapter, along with the creature's type and challenge rating (CR).

## Using a Stat Block

This chapter is a companion to the "Monster Manual" and adopts a similar presentation. If you are unfamiliar with the monster stat block format, read the "introduction" of the "Monster Manual" before proceeding further. That book explains stat block terminology and gives rules for various monster traits—information that isn't repeated here.

### Unusual Attacks and Magic

Herein you will find some weapons that deal unusual damage types and spellcasting that functions in atypical ways. Such an exception is a special feature of a stat block and represents how the creature uses the weapon or casts its spells; the exception has no effect on how a weapon or a spell functions for someone else.

### Meeting Magic Item Prerequisites

If a stat block contains the name of a class in the creature's name or in parentheses under the name, the creature is considered a member of that class for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for magic items.

### Lorehold Scholars

The archaeomancers of Lorehold College draw their magical might from the flow of time and fate and the way those forces shape the course of history. Scholars of this broad mystical study divide between those who see history as an unpredictable jumble of chance and those who believe events form a perfect—and predictable—pattern.

### Prismari Scholars

The scholars of Prismari College believe that art is the truest form of spellcraft. They use magic to make splendid art, and they employ artistry to make their magic spectacular.

### Quandrix Scholars

The scholars of Quandrix College focus on the mathematical principles that govern reality. Through these formulas, they can manipulate properties of matter and space, as well as abstract and conceptual space such as the mind, probability, and the flow of magic itself.

### Silverquill Scholars

The scholars of Silverquill College study the power of magic shaped through spoken and written words. They use that power either to illuminate and guide or to obscure and demoralize.
