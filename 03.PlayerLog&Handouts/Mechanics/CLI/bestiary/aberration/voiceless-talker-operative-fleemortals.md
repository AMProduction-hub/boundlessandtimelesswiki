      \ enemy within 10 feet of the operative must make a DC 10 plus PB Strength saving\
      \ throw. On a failed save, a creature takes PBd6 force damage and is pushed\

      \ saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage,\
      \ and for 1 minute, the target's proficiency bonus is cumulatively lowered by\
      \ 1 and the infiltrator gains a cumulative +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls\
      \ and to each feature's save DC. On a successful save, a target takes half as\
      \ much damage and doesn't have their proficiency bonus reduced.\n\nA creature\
      \ whose proficiency bonus drops to 0 can't form new thoughts or speak, and they\
      \ have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws."
