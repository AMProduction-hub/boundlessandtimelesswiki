# [Usagt](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\aberration/usagt-aitfr-thp.md)
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: The Hidden Page p. 14*  

These peculiar creatures originate on a tranquil, lawful plane where they lead gentle, languid existences. They enjoy the experiences of life—in memory and in practice—but have curiously few ambitions. Their natural lifespan is centuries long, and they give little thought to the passage of time.

Some scholars of the planes believe usagt are not organisms in any traditional sense but a kind of intelligent being made of notions and psychic matter.

## Curiously Shy

An usagt's true form is amorphous and [invisible](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible). They change shape based on the thoughts and memories they observe in other creatures' memories. Each usagt thus has a peculiar sense of itself and its peers, based on what shapes it can take in what order, rather than any visual cues of its own.

## Cunning Observers

The favorite pastime of most usagt is putting on little improvised plays with others of its kind, changing shapes throughout. Usagt observe other creatures and detect their thoughts to broaden the catalog of characters they can portray.

## Strange Nature

Usagt do not reproduce. An usagt requires no food, drink, or sleep, but enjoys them when it can. It does require air.
