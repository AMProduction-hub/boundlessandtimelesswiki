      \ lowered by 1 and the voiceless talker gains a cumulative +2 bonus to damage\

      \ have their proficiency bonus reduced.\n\nA creature whose proficiency bonus\
      \ drops to 0 can't form new thoughts or speak, and they have disadvantage on\

      \ equipment they carry for the duration.\n\nThe changes wrought by this power\
      \ fail to hold up to physical inspection. A creature can use an action to inspect\
      \ the voiceless talker's appearance and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation))\
