# [Jijibisha Manivarshi](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/jijibisha-manivarshi-jttrc.md)
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel p. 128*  

Jijibisha Manivarshi, a vicious soul from the land's past, lurks in the nearby forest. Long ago she made a deal with wicked otherworldly forces that gave her longevity and fiendish powers, a bargain that ultimately resulted in the ruin of Manivarsha.

Despite her fiendish powers, she looks like an ancient, withered human.
