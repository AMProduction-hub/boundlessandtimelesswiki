# [Shunn Shurreth](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/shunn-shurreth-wdmm.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 33*  

A drow priestess of Lolth placed a curse on Shunn and forced him into exile after he displeased her. The curse partially transformed him into a spider, giving him eight red arachnid eyes, a mouth full of fangs, and black bristles sprouting from his slender limbs. A remove curse or [greater restoration](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell restores Shunn's natural form, but Shunn doesn't want the curse lifted. His horrific appearance strikes fear into the hearts of his comrades-in-arms and has earned him favor with Xanathar. Shunn believes that returning to his normal form might weaken his influence over his gang and diminish his status in the Xanathar Guild.
