# [Skeemo Weirdbottle](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/skeemo-weirdbottle-wdh.md)
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 200*  

Skeemo became the Master of Magic for the Black Network in Waterdeep, setting up a cover in the Trades Ward in the form of a cramped little shop called Weirdbottle's Concoctions. Most of his potions and elixirs are nonmagical, but he crafts magical ones for his Zhent friends.

Skeemo can add "sellout" to his credentials, his services having been bought by House Gralhund and the Black Network operatives loyal to Manshoon. The rock gnome uses paper birds (see appendix A) to send messages both to his new friends and his old ones.

## The Doom Raiders

The Doom Raiders were five unscrupulous adventurers who liked to plunder lich lairs (called "dooms" by some). They gave up adventuring to join the Black Network and came to Waterdeep three years ago with plans to establish a Zhentarim foothold in the city. In that time, they have forged alliances with various nobles and guilds and run afoul of others, all the while fending off Harper spies.
