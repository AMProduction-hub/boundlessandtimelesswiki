# [Kharbek](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/kharbek-cm.md)
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 167*  

Kharbek, a 145-year-old shield dwarf, is the only survivor of a party of adventurers captured by the Order of the Immortal Lotus. If questioned, Kharbek is able to recall how a member of the Immortal Lotus disguised as a beggar lured the group to the temple, where the adventurers were tortured one by one. Kharbek's weapons rest on a nearby table. If their wounds are healed and levels of [exhaustion](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) removed, Kharbek offers to fight alongside the characters as a sign of gratitude.

Kharbek is a mountain dwarf explorer with brown skin, brown eyes, and jet-black hair. They stand just over 4 feet tall and have an athletic build.
