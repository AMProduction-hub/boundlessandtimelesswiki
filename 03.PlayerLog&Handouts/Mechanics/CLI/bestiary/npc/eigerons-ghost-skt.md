    "name": "Etherealness"
  - "desc": "One humanoid or giant that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must\
      \ succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the\
      \ ghost then disappears, and the target is [incapacitated](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
      \ and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't\
      \ deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack,\
      \ spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment,\
      \ Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being [charmed](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ and [frightened](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened).\
      \ It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access\
      \ to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.\n\nThe possession\
      \ lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action,\
      \ or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the [dispel evil and\
      \ good](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md)\
      \ spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space\
      \ within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession\
      \ for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession\
      \ ends. If a creature possessed by the ghost is forcibly removed from the Eye\
      \ of Annam, the ghost is expelled from its host and re-forms in the middle of\
      \ this room."
