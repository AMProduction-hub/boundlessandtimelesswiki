*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 252*  

Goldenfields' crops are vital to Waterdeep's survival, which is why the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors sent Naxene to make sure the temple-farm is adequately defended. At first she regarded the task as a punishment, but now she appreciates the peace and quiet.

Ideal:"There's no problem that can't be solved with magic."

Bond:"I have great respect for Lady Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep. She and the Lords' Alliance are going to bring some much-needed order to this lawless land."

Flaw:"I'm too smart to be wrong about anything."
