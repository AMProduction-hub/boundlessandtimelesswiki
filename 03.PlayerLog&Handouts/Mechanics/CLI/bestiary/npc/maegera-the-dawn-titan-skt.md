# [Maegera the Dawn Titan](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/maegera-the-dawn-titan-skt.md)
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 241*  

Maegera is powerful elemental that has been trapped in the forges of Gauntlgrym for millennia. About fifty years ago, Maegera briefly escaped and triggered the eruption of Mount Hotenow. Lava from the volcano flowed toward the coast, laying waste to Neverwinter. The city is still rebuilding in the wake of that catastrophe.

The fire giant duke Zalto recently sent a team of drow to infiltrate Gauntlgrym and trap Maegera in an iron flask . Zalto needs the primordial to ignite an adamantine forge beneath the Ice Spires. Returning Maegera to Gauntlgrym is one way to thwart the fire giant's plans.

Maegera looks like a 50-foot-tall, multi-limbed beast made of flame, with smoldering black pits for eyes.
