      \ can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\
      \nAt will: [dancing lights](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/dancing-lights.md),\
      \ [minor illusion](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/minor-illusion.md),\

    "name": "Claws"
  - "desc": "Pu'pu covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical\
      \ illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and\
      \ humanoid shape. The illusion ends if Pu'pu takes a bonus action to end it\
      \ or if she dies.\n\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical\
      \ inspection. For example, Pu'pu could appear to have smooth skin, but someone\
      \ touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an\
      \ action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence\
      \ ([Investigation](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation))\
      \ check to discern that Pu'pu is disguised."
    "name": "Illusory Appearance"
  - "desc": "Pu'pu magically turns [invisible](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible)\
      \ until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her [concentration](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
      \ ends (as if [concentrating](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
      \ on a spell). While [invisible](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible),\
      \ she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only\
      \ by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is [invisible](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible)\
      \ with her."
