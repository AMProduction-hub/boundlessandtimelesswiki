      \ it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size,\

      \ It reverts to its true form if it dies."
    "name": "Shapechanger"

      \ against any creature it [surprised](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Surprised)."
    "name": "Ambusher"
  - "desc": "If Willifort surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the\

      \ 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt,\
      \ 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While\
      \ the target is in range, Willifort can continue reading its thoughts, as long\
      \ as Willifort's [concentration](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
      \ isn't broken (as if [concentrating](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Concentration)\
      \ on a spell). While reading the target's mind, Willifort has advantage on Wisdom\
      \ ([Insight](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) and\
      \ Charisma ([Deception](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception),\
