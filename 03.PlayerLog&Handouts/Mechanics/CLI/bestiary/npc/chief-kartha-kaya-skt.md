  - "desc": "Chief Kartha-Kaya attempts to magically possess a humanoid or giant.\
      \ Chief Kartha-Kaya must touch the target throughout a short rest, or the attempt\
      \ fails. At the end of the rest, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution\
      \ saving throw or be possessed by Chief Kartha-Kaya, which disappears with everything\
      \ it is carrying and wearing. Until the possession ends, the target is [incapacitated](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated),\
      \ loses control of its body, and is unaware of its surroundings. Chief Kartha-Kaya\
      \ now controls the body and can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other\
      \ effect, and it retains its alignment; its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma\
      \ scores; and its proficiencies. It otherwise uses the target's statistics,\
      \ except the target's knowledge, class features, feats, and proficiencies.\n\
      \nThe possession lasts until either the body drops to 0 hit points, Chief Kartha-Kaya\
      \ ends the possession as an action, or Chief Kartha-Kaya is forced out of the\
      \ body by an effect such as the [dispel evil and good](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md)\
      \ spell. When the possession ends, Chief Kartha-Kaya reappears in an unoccupied\
      \ space within 5 feet of the body and is [stunned](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Stunned)\
      \ until the end of its next turn. If the host body dies while it is possessed\
      \ by Chief Kartha-Kaya, Chief Kartha-Kaya dies as well, and its body doesn't\
      \ reappear."
