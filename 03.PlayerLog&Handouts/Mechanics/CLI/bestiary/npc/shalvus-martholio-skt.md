*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 250*  

Nalaskur Thaelond of Bargewright Inn has entrusted the shepherd Shalvus with an important assignment: to figure out the best way by which Goldenfields can be brought under the Black Network's control. Shalvus believes that success will ensure his swift rise through the Zhentarim ranks.

Ideal:"I'll do what it takes to prove myself to the Zhentarim."

Bond:"I love animals, and I'm very protective of them."

Flaw:"I can't resist taking risks to feed my ambitions."
