I don't know the real reason of how the ranger came into information on this lord of Hell, but he claims it has something to do with his hamster. His hamster! How did I ever get bamboozled into editing this tome.

Mephistopheles is the lord of Cania, the eighth level of the Nine Hells, and the most powerful archdevil next to Asmodeus himself. He is famed as Hell's most powerful wizard and the wielder of a power known as Hellfire.

Mephistopheles is an ancient entity, a being rivaling even Asmodeus in terms of age. During his time as an archdevil he had been responsible for many schemes to try and unseat the Lord of the Nine. One of his infamous schemes was an alliance between himself, Dispater, Mammon, and Geryon. They conspired to take power from the other archdevils, Baalzebul, Zariel, Belial and Moloch. With this increased power, Mephistopheles would then be able to challenge Asmodeus himself. But he was betrayed by Geryon, who had been secretly siding with Asmodeus. Despite the blatancy of his rebellion, he was the archdevil that suffered the least: not cursed like Mammon or Baalzebul; not cast down like Belial, Moloch or Geryon. This has led many to believe that there is some ancient secret to the relationship between the Asmodeus and Mephistopheles, though what it could be is a mystery none have discovered.

Mephistopheles is a brilliant tactician and strategist, and he has an unparalleled understanding of Hell's political machinations and the potential pitfalls of every scheme and alliance. He is courteous and charming when he speaks, demonstrating a wry wit while projecting an image of self-restraint and composure. But beneath this civil persona lurks a savage, barely controlled temper, and he often flies into uncontrollable rages when alone in his palace. In addition to his barely contained anger, Mephistopheles suffers from obsessive envy, and he is bitterly resentful that he is "merely" the second most powerful archdevil.

As the foremost wizard of the Nine Hells, Mephistopheles often resorts to magic when forced to defend himself. But his greatest power comes from the ability to wield Hellfire itself. Created by tapping into the profane essence of Hell, Hellfire is unimaginably, unbearably hot. Unless he chooses to suppress it, his body emanates dark flames, causing anyone who touches him to be scorched by the unholy energy. Mephistopheles can also shape Hellfire any way he wishes, making it his most potent weapon.
