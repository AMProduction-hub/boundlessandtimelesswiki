    \ spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures\
    \ or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot.\
    \ Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell\
    \ has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from\
    \ the areas affected by such spells. Lulu can use an action to suppress this trait\
