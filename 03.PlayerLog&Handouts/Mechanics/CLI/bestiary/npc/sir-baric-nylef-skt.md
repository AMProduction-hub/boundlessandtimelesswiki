# [Sir Baric Nylef](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/sir-baric-nylef-skt.md)
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 249*  

As a knight of the Order of the Gauntlet, Sir Baric has sworn oaths to catch evildoers and bring them to justice. His current quarry is a dwarf brigand, Worvil "the Weevil" Forkbeard, who is rumored to be hiding in Icewind Dale. In addition to his gear, Sir Baric has an unarmored warhorse, Henry.

Ideal:"Evil must not be allowed to thrive in this world."

Bond:"Tyr is my lord; the order, my family. Through my actions, I shall honor both."

Flaw:"I'm not afraid to die. When Tyr finally calls me, I'll go to him happily."
