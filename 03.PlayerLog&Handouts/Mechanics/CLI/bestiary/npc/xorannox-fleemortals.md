  - "desc": "Xorannox creates three of the following psionic eye effects. Unless otherwise\
      \ stated, each eye targets a creature who he can see within 120 feet of him.\
      \ He can't use the same effect twice on a turn.\n\n- **1. Charm Beam.** The\
      \ targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ by Xorannox for 1 hour, or until he harms the creature or one of their allies.\
      \  \n- **2. Compulsion Beam.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17\
      \ Intelligence saving throw or use their reaction, if available, to move up\
      \ to their speed toward the closest ally they can see and make one weapon attack\
      \ against them. Creatures who can't be [charmed](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
      \ are unaffected.  \n- **3. Memory Beam.** The targeted creature must make a\
      \ DC 17 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, if the creature has unexpended\
      \ spell slots, they expend a spell slot of their highest remaining level, with\
      \ no effect. If they don't have unexpended spell slots, they instead lose proficiency\
      \ with a weapon they're holding or carrying for 1 minute (save ends at end of\
      \ turn).  \n- **4. Toxic Vapors.** Xorannox chooses a point he can see within\
      \ 120 feet of him. Each creature within 10 feet of the point must succeed on\
      \ a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned)\
      \ for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn).  \n- **5. Telekinetic Field.** Xorannox\
      \ chooses a point he can see within 120 feet of him. Each enemy within 10 feet\
      \ of the point must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be moved up\
      \ to 30 feet in any direction and take 7 (2d6) force damage at the end of\
      \ the move. Additionally, Xorannox can target any object within 10 feet of the\
      \ point that weighs 300 pounds or less and isn't being worn or carried, moving\
      \ it up to 30 feet in any direction. Xorannox can also exert fine control on\
      \ objects with this effect, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a\
      \ door or a container.  \n- **6. Lightning Bolt.** Xorannox shoots a 5-foot-wide,\
      \ 60-foot-long line of lightning. Each creature in the line must succeed on\
      \ a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) lightning damage on a failed\
      \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- **7. Explosion.** Xorannox\
      \ chooses a point he can see within 120 feet of him. Each creature within 10\
      \ feet of the point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8)\
      \ fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\
      \  \n- **8. Necrosis Beam.** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution\
      \ saving throw or immediately take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage and lose 7 (2d6)\
      \ hit points at the start of each of their turns. If this effect reduces a target's\
      \ hit points to 0, they die. The effect ends if Xorannox dies or can't see the\
      \ target. This psionic effect can't be used again while this effect persists.\
