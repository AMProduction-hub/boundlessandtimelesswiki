# [Dzaan's Simulacrum](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/dzaans-simulacrum-idrotf.md)
*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 270*  

Unbeknownst to his executioners, Dzaan had used a spell scroll of simulacrum to create a copy of himself. This simulacrum dwells in the sunken Netherese spire, waiting for its creator to return.

The simulacrum, which looks and acts like Dzaan, has half of Dzaan's hit points and can't regain expended spell slots. It has wasted its 3rd-level spell slots trying to reach Dzaan with [sending](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/sending.md) spells, to no avail, and has expended other spell slots to help it survive the perils of the spire. It uses its remaining spell slots sparingly.

The sunken Netherese tower contains a special room that can transform the simulacrum into a real person—or any magical illusion into the real thing, for that matter. If this change occurs, the simulacrum effectively becomes a clone of Dzaan, authentic in every way.
