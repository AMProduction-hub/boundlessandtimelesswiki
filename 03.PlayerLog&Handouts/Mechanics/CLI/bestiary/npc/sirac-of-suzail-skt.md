# [Sirac of Suzail](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/sirac-of-suzail-skt.md)
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 247*  

An acolyte of Torm, Sirac grew up on the streets of Suzail, the capital of Cormyr. He came to Icewind Dale to become a knucklehead trout fisher but instead found religion. The misbegotten son of Artus Cimber, a renowned human adventurer, Sirac hasn't seen his father since he was a baby.

Ideal:"Without duty or loyalty, a man is nothing."

Bond:"Icewind Dale is where I belong for the rest of my life."

Flaw:"I am honest to a fault."
