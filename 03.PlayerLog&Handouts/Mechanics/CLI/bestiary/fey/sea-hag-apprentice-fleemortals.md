    "name": "Signature Attack (Zap)"
  - "desc": "As a bonus action, the apprentice rides a crashing wave. They make a\
      \ signature attack against an enemy within 5 feet of them and move up to their\
      \ walking speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If the attack hits, it\
      \ deals an extra PB bludgeoning damage."
    "name": "3rd Level: Wash Away (3/Day)"
  - "desc": "As an action, the apprentice supercharges their foe's nervous system.\
      \ The apprentice makes a signature attack, and if it deals damage to a creature,\
      \ the target must make a DC 10 plus PB Constitution saving throw. On a failed\
      \ save, the target is [incapacitated](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)\
      \ and their speed is halved until the end of their next turn."
    "name": "5th Level: Ride the Lightning (3/Day)"
  - "desc": "As an action, the apprentice chooses three creatures the apprentice can\
      \ see within 60 feet of them. Each target feels as though their lungs are filling\
      \ with water and must make a DC 10 plus PB Constitution saving throw. A creature\
      \ who can breathe water or who doesn't need air automatically succeeds on this\
      \ saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes PBd8 force damage, and for\
      \ 1 minute, they can't speak, their speed is halved, and they are [dazed](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Dazed)\
      \ (save ends at end of turn). On a successful save, the target takes half as\
      \ much damage and suffers no other effect. Another creature within 5 feet of\
      \ a target can use their action to make a DC 10 plus PB Strength ([Athletics](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics))\
      \ or Intelligence ([Medicine](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine))\
      \ check, ending the effect on a success."
