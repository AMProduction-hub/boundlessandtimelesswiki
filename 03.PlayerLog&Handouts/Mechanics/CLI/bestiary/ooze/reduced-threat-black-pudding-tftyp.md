  - "desc": "A creature that touches the pudding or hits it with a melee attack while\
      \ within 5 feet of it takes 4 (d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made\
      \ of metal or wood that hits the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the\
      \ weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its\
      \ penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of\
      \ metal or wood that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage. The\
      \ pudding can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round."
