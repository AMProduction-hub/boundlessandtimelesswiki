# [Vargouille Reflection](03 - Player Log & Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\fiend/vargouille-reflection-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 52, Sigil and the Outlands*  

Vargouilles are flying Fiends that resemble disembodied Humanoid heads with wings. While most vargouilles roam the planes to curse Humanoids and create more vargouilles, a variant known as the vargouille reflection resides in Undersigil. When a vargouille reflection spots a Humanoid target, it takes on that creature's visage, terrifying that creature by appearing as its own disembodied head.
