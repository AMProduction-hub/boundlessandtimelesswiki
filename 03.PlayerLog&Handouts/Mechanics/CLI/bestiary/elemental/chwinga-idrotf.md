*Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 282*  

A chwinga is a tiny elemental spirit that lives in plants, rocks, and rivers far from civilization. Those found in cold climates also live in ice and snow. Painfully shy, chwingas prefer to move about unseen.

Chwingas resemble 6-inch-tall animated dolls with mask-like faces, spindly limbs, and wild hair. Their appearance is sometimes foreshadowed by gentle breezes, the sweet smell of flowers, dancing fireflies, or snowflakes. They don't have names and cannot speak.

## Humanoid Fascination

Chwingas find the trappings of civilization fascinating. They puzzle over creatures that wear armor, carry weapons, use tools, and cook food. When a chwinga encounters one or more humanoids, its curiosity sometimes gets the better of it, and it follows them for a short time to observe them. If it takes a liking to a humanoid, a chwinga might use its cantrips to aid the creature, or it might bestow a magical gift before departing. The aspect that attracts a chwinga to a humanoid can take any form. In some cases, a chwinga might simply like the way a humanoid walks or the way it combs its hair. Other times, it might be smitten by a humanoid's ability to play music or to eat copious amounts of food.

## Chwingas in Icewind Dale

Chwingas first appeared in the published adventure Tomb of Annihilation as creatures indigenous to the tropical peninsula of Chult. As spirits of the elements, however, they range far and wide. Large numbers of them came to Icewind Dale with immigrants from Chult and made new homes for themselves in and around Ten-Towns. Those that remained near civilization adopted the garb of their humanoid neighbors, creating miniature coats for themselves. They can sometimes be seen riding on arctic foxes or snowshoe hares. Others wandered into the tundra, changing their coloration to blend in with their surroundings.

Exposure to Auril's nightly aurora and the unnatural blizzards she creates can cause chwingas to behave unpredictably, even insanely.

## New Chwinga Charms

This section describes several new charms that chwingas living in Icewind Dale or other cold regions can bestow using their Magical Gift action.
