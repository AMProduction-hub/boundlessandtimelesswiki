  - "desc": "The camel is considered to be one size larger for the purpose of determining\

    "name": "Beast of Burden"
  - "desc": "The camel ignores difficult terrain created by dirt or sand. They can\
      \ tolerate temperatures as high as 120° Fahrenheit."

      \ up to 90 days."
    "name": "Metabolic Reserves"
  - "desc": "The camel has advantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the [charmed](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed),\
      \ [frightened](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened),\

"actions":

    "name": "Signature Attack (Bite or Kick)"
  - "desc": "The camel spits at a creature they can see within 10 feet of them. The\
      \ target must succeed on a DC 10 plus PB Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned)\
      \ until the start of the camel's next turn."
    "name": "1st Level: Bilious Spit (2 Ferocity)"
  - "desc": "The camel moves up to their speed and makes a signature Bite attack against\
      \ one target. If the attack hits and the target is Medium or smaller, the camel\
      \ also shakes and flings them up to 10 feet away horizontally. If the target\
      \ hits a solid surface, they are knocked [prone](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
      \ and take an extra PB bludgeoning damage."
    "name": "3rd Level: Punishing Shake (5 Ferocity)"
  - "desc": "The camel moves up to their speed. During this move, they can move through\
      \ other creature's spaces. Each Large or smaller creature whose space the camel\
      \ passes through must make a DC 10 plus PB Strength saving throw. On a failed\
      \ save, a creature takes PBd6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
      \ On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked\
      \ [prone](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."

      \ and the camel can see them, the camel moves up to their speed toward their\
      \ caregiver. If they end this movement in the same space as their caregiver,\
      \ attacks against the caregiver have disadvantage until either the caregiver\
      \ is no longer [prone](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone),\
      \ the caregiver is no longer in the same space as the camel, or the start of\
