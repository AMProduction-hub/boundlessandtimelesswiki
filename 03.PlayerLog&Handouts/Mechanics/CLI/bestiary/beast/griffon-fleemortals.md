  - "desc": "If the griffon flies more than 20 feet in a straight line toward their\
      \ target and then hits them with a Claw attack on the same turn, the target\
      \ is [grappled](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\
      \ (escape DC 14). While the target is [grappled](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\
      \ in this way, the griffon has advantage on Beak attacks against the target\
      \ but can't make Claw attacks. Grappling a Medium or smaller creature imposes\

      \ not [grappled](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)\
      \ by the griffon within a 30-foot cone originating from the griffon must make\
      \ a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5 (2d4)\
      \ bludgeoning damage, is pushed 5 feet away from the griffon, and is knocked\
      \ [prone](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)."
    "name": "Buffet"
  - "desc": "The griffon lets out an earsplitting screech. Each enemy within 60 feet\
      \ of the griffon who can hear them must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw\
      \ or be [frightened](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
      \ of the griffon for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn). If a creature's saving\
      \ throw is successful or the effect ends for them, they are immune to the Piercing\
      \ Cry of all griffons for the next 24 hours."
