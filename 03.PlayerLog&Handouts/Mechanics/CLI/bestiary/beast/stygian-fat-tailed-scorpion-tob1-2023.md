# [Stygian Fat-Tailed Scorpion](03 - Player Log & Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\beast/stygian-fat-tailed-scorpion-tob1-2023.md)
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 320*  

*The scorpion's black carapace gleams in the desert sun, and its tail drips translucent venom.*

## Highly Venomous

Known for its small size and aggressive behavior, the Stygian fat-tailed scorpion brings a swift death to those who feel its toxic sting.

## Pit Traps

A Stygian fat-tailed scorpion is no more than a foot long, with a tail about the same length. It weighs no more than five pounds for the largest specimens. They make excellent guard animals that require little food or care, and they are often kept at the bottom of pits or in rarely used tunnels.

## Valuable Venom

A dose of fat-tailed scorpion venom can be worth 4,000 gp or more to the right buyer.
