      \ by following the command. If the target can't follow Ellan's command, the\
      \ spell ends. Some typical commands and their effects follow:\n\n- **Approach.**\
      \ The target moves toward Ellan by the shortest and most direct route, ending\
      \ their turn if they move within 5 feet of Ellan.  \n- **Drop.** The target\
      \ drops whatever they are holding and then ends their turn.  \n- **Flee.** The\
      \ target spends their turn moving away from Ellan by the fastest available means.\
      \  \n- **Grovel.** The target falls [prone](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\

      \ no actions.  "
