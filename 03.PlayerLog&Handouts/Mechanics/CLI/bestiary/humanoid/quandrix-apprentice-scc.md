# [Quandrix Apprentice](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/quandrix-apprentice-scc.md)
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 208*  

The students of Quandrix College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—immerse themselves in the magic of geometry and metaphysics. Their ultimate goal isn't mastery, however. Rather, in their projects they explore and expand knowledge without expecting concrete answers. Whether students are extrapolating mathematical patterns in nature or engaging in speculative dives into topological formulas that bend reality, their studies blur the line between abstract numerical theory and natural reality.

## Quandrix Scholars

The scholars of Quandrix College focus on the mathematical principles that govern reality. Through these formulas, they can manipulate properties of matter and space, as well as abstract and conceptual space such as the mind, probability, and the flow of magic itself.
