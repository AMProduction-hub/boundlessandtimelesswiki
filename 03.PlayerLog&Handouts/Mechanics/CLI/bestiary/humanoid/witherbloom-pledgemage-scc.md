*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 222*  

Deep in the fog and muck of the swamp, the students of Witherbloom College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—study the cycle of life and death. Their magic is fueled by what they call life essence: the ubiquitous energy that runs through living things.

Witherbloom students learn how to concoct magical potions and talismans, in addition to their spellcasting studies. Their magic ranges from necrotic shadows and withering bursts of poison to flourishing bursts of plant life.

## Witherbloom Scholars

Witherbloom College studies the magic inherent in the natural cycle of life and death. Witherbloom professors approach the philosophy from different directions, with one methodology focusing on decay and the other dealing with growth.
