# [Skyweaver](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/skyweaver-pota.md)
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 191*  

Skyweavers brim with rage and desire, which makes them perfect vessels for the wildly destructive magic of the Cult of the Howling Hatred. In contrast to their hurricane counterparts in the air cult, skyweavers embrace the worship of Elemental Evil for a quick path to power. With little experience wielding the might of the elements, skyweavers thrill with the rush of releasing raw elemental energy.
