      \ or be knocked [prone](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone).\
      \ Succeed or fail, the decanus then makes two signature attacks against any\

    "name": "5th Level: Shield Bash (3/Day)"
  - "desc": "The decanus moves up to their speed, then makes a number of signature\
      \ attacks equal to the number of enemies within 5 feet of them (minimum of three\
      \ attacks). Each enemy within range must be attacked at least once. On a hit,\
      \ the target must succeed on a DC 10 plus PB Charisma saving throw or be [frightened](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened)\
      \ of the decanus for 1 minute (save ends at end of turn)."
