# [Prismari Professor of Expression](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\humanoid/prismari-professor-of-expression-scc.md)
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 206*  

Professors of expression embody the flare of Prismari magic. Using continuous motion, fluid grace, and interweaving steps, these teachers channel the elements of wind, flame, and lightning to accompany them. Their magic is fast and beautiful, which becomes swift death in battle, mesmerizing in its energetic flow. Devastating lightning strikes and searing lashes of flame meet the professors' foes head on.

Professors who embrace the Prismari philosophy of expression focus on magic becoming art in the moment. Whether to create a spectacle that an audience will never forget or to strike down their foes in a flash, these teachers impress upon their students the beauty of creation.

## Prismari Scholars

The scholars of Prismari College believe that art is the truest form of spellcraft. They use magic to make splendid art, and they employ artistry to make their magic spectacular.
