    \ must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or have the [charmed](03%20-%20Player%20Log%20&%20Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)\
    \ condition for 1 minute, during which time it follows the captain's command.\
    \ The effect ends early if the target takes damage or if it successfully completes\
    \ the command. A target automatically succeeds on its saving throw if the command\
    \ is directly harmful to itself, such as commanding it to walk into fire.\n\n\
    A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending\
    \ the effect on itself on a successful save."
