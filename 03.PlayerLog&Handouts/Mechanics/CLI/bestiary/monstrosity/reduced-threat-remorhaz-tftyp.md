      \ creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving\
      \ throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which\
      \ fall [prone](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone)\
      \ in a space within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed\
      \ creature is no longer [restrained](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)\
