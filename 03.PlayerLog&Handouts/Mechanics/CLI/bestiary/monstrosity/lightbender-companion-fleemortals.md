      \ each appear in an unoccupied space they can see within 30 feet of their imprints,\
      \ the attack misses, then the imprints disappear. The lightbender can't use\
      \ this reaction if the attacker relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight,\
      \ or if they can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight."
