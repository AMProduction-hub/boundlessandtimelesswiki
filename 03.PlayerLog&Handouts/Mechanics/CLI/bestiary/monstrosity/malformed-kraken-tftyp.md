# [Malformed Kraken](03.PlayerLog&Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\monstrosity/malformed-kraken-tftyp.md)
*Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 239*  

The Doomvault (Dead in Thay) contains a number of denizens that don't have all the traits or abilities of normal creatures of their kind. By far the most powerful of these "inferior" creatures is a malformed kraken that is kept in a saltwater pool and is not as large or as durable as a true kraken
