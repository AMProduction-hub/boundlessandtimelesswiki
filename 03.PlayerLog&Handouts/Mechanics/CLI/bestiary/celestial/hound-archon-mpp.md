# [Hound Archon](03 - Player Log & Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\celestial/hound-archon-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 16*  

Hound archons are the foot soldiers of Mount Celestia, tasked with protecting the innocent and helpless. Loyal defenders, these bipedal warriors wield blades of shining radiance and can assume canine forms, allowing them to inconspicuously guard peaceable communities as dogs and wolves.

## Archons

Archons are denizens of the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia. Created by the powers of order and benevolence, archons defend their home from fiendish incursions and safeguard those threatened by wicked forces. Archons are skilled communicators, able to speak all the languages of the multiverse. When pushed into combat, they prefer to subdue foes. However, against Fiends, archons are wrathful combatants, manifesting the righteous vengeance of Mount Celestia to strike down the wicked.

Each archon's form corresponds to its place within the Celestial hierarchy. When faced in battle, archons radiate the full fury of the Upper Planes, bolstering their allies and cowing their foes.
