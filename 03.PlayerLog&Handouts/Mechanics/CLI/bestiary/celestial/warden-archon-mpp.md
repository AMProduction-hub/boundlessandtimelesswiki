# [Warden Archon](03 - Player Log & Handouts\Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\celestial/warden-archon-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 18, Sigil and the Outlands*  

Warden archons are vigilant, ursine guardians of portals and paths connected to goodly realms. They have powerfully built, bipedal bodies with the heads of great bears and eyes like pools of silvery light. When warden archons speak, glimmering radiance shines from within their mouths, punctuating their deep, resonant voices.

A warden archon knows when a creature uses a portal the archon is tasked to guard, and it moves swiftly to interrogate any who cross that planar boundary. If an invader enters the archon's plane, the warden strikes with claw and tooth, using its powerful bite to magically mark the intruder, which the archon pursues relentlessly.

## Archons

Archons are denizens of the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia. Created by the powers of order and benevolence, archons defend their home from fiendish incursions and safeguard those threatened by wicked forces. Archons are skilled communicators, able to speak all the languages of the multiverse. When pushed into combat, they prefer to subdue foes. However, against Fiends, archons are wrathful combatants, manifesting the righteous vengeance of Mount Celestia to strike down the wicked.

Each archon's form corresponds to its place within the Celestial hierarchy. When faced in battle, archons radiate the full fury of the Upper Planes, bolstering their allies and cowing their foes.
