      \ 5 feet of the creature, the target must succeed on a DC 10 plus PB Dexterity\

      \ (escape DC 10 plus PB) and take 1d4 piercing damage plus PBd8 necrotic\

      \ bats and insects. Every enemy within 10 feet of the neophyte must make a DC\
      \ 10 plus PB Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes PBd4\
      \ piercing damage plus PBd4 slashing damage. On a successful save, a creature\
      \ takes half as much damage. At the end of the turn, the neophyte reforms in\
      \ an unoccupied space within 30 feet of where they disappeared."
