      \ piercing damage. If three or more crawling claws joined the attack, the target\
      \ must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease called\
      \ gravefilth. Whenever a power, a spell, or a similar supernatural effect causes\
      \ a creature with gravefilth to regain hit points, the number of hit points\
      \ they regain is halved. A creature with gravefilth can repeat the saving throw\
      \ whenever they finish a long rest. On a successful save, the disease is cured."
