    "name": "Signature Attack (Longsword)"
  - "desc": "As a reaction to an ally the deathguard can see within 5 feet of them\
      \ being hit with an attack, the deathguard redirects the attack to themself,\
      \ potentially causing the attack to miss. If the attacker is within 5 feet of\
      \ the deathguard, the deathguard can make a signature attack against the attacker."
    "name": "3rd Level: Blood for Blood (3/Day)"
  - "desc": "As an action, the deathguard shrouds themself in dark energy. The deathguard\
      \ regains PBd6 hit points, and each enemy within 5 feet of the deathguard\
      \ must make a DC 10 plus PB Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target\
      \ takes PBd6 necrotic damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as\
      \ much damage."
    "name": "5th Level: Soul Thief (3/Day)"
  - "desc": "As an action, the deathguard moves up to their speed without provoking\
      \ opportunity attacks. Each ally the deathguard passes within 5 feet of during\
      \ the move can use a reaction to move up to their speed in the same direction\
      \ as the deathguard without provoking opportunity attacks. Until the start of\
      \ the deathguard's next turn, attacks against these allies have disadvantage."
