# Appendix C: Sidekicks
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen, p. 210* 

This appendix presents six sidekicks—special NPCs who can accompany the player characters on their adventures. The following sidekicks are appropriate for a 1st-level adventuring party. Consider adding one or more sidekicks to round out your characters' group if there are fewer than four players. As the DM, you can play sidekicks, or players can play them alongside their own characters. You can read more about "sidekicks" in "Tasha's Cauldron of Everything".

If a sidekick accompanies the characters into later levels, the sidekick also advances in level. This represents a combination of the adventures the sidekick has shared with the group and the sidekick's own training.

A sidekick's level should always equal the average level of the adventuring party, and it should go up whenever the group's average level does. Consult the tables throughout this appendix for guidance on how to update the sidekicks' stat blocks when they advance to levels 2 through 11.

## Allies at War

The NPCs here can join the characters as sidekicks. Each has a background in the lands of Ansalon, but you can customize these stories as suits your campaign. You can also play these characters as heroes in *Dragonlance: Warriors of Krynn*.
