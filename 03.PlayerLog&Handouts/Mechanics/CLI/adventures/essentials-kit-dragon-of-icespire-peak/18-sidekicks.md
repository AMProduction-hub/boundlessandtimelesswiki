# Sidekicks
*Source: Essentials Kit: Dragon of Icespire Peak, p. 66* 

On your adventures, the DM might reveal that you've befriended a special character called a sidekick, who joins your party. This appendix presents the game statistics for sidekicks, of which there are three types:

**Expert**, an agile and exceedingly helpful jack of all trades

**Spellcaster**, a magic-user who can cast spells to harm your foes or heal you and your friends

**Warrior**, a martial companion who specializes in striking your foes or defending you and your allies

The DM will either tell you which type of sidekick to use or let you choose one. It's up to you and the DM to decide who controls the sidekick in play.
