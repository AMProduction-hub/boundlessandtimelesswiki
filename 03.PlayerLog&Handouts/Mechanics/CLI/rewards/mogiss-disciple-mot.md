# Mogis's Disciple
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 25+ Mogis trait*

Countless battles and vicious visions have given you focus. You have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened).
