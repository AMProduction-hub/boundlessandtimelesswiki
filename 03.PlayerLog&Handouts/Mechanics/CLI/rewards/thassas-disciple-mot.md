# Thassa's Disciple
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 25+ Thassa trait*

You are inspired by the tempestuous, uncontrollable nature of the sea; you have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [restrained](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Restrained).
