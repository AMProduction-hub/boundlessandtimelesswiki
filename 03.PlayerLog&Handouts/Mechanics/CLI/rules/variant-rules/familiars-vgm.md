# Familiars
*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 213* 

Any spellcaster that can cast the [find familiar](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-familiar.md) spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [cranium rat](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/cranium-rat-mpmm.md), a [crawling claw](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/crawling-claw.md), a [gazer](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/gazer-mpmm.md), an [imp](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/imp.md), a [pseudodragon](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon.md), or a [quasit](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md).
