`dice: [](outlands-humanoids-mpp.md#^outlands-humanoids)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The characters need to find a wandering [priest](priest.md) who alone knows the ritual necessary to open a specific portal. |
| 2 | Several gnome [mages](mage.md) seek help recovering their walking castle from a band of aggressive, spine-covered [lizardfolk](lizardfolk.md) influenced by "the Abyss". |
| 3 | The characters stumble across a youthful or elderly [commoner](commoner.md) who doesn't know how they came to be in the Outlands and who wants only to go home. |
| 4 | A [bandit captain](bandit-captain.md) and his gang seek the characters' help as they plan a heist in the realm of an immortal being, like the "Realm of the Norns" or "Wonderhome" (see "Sigil and the Outlands" for details on both locations). |
