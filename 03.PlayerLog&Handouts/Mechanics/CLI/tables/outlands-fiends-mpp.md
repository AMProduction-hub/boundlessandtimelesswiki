| 3 | A hero requests the characters' help in gaining the aid of a legendary steed called a nic'epona, a [nightmare](nightmare.md) influenced by one of the Upper Planes. |
| 4 | Rival [incubi](incubus.md) seek to recruit the characters to serve either a [balor](balor.md) warlord or a [pit fiend](pit-fiend.md) general whose fiendish armies are prepared to clash nearby. |
