`dice: [](outlands-monstrosities-mpp.md#^outlands-monstrosities)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The characters are hired to recover cargo from a crashed vessel brimming with rare technology, but the wreckage is overrun with [rust monsters](rust-monster.md). |
| 2 | The characters have to retrieve a treasure from a group of mischievous [sprites](sprite.md). The sprites are secretly defended by [mimics](mimic.md) influenced by "Elysium" that take the form of tiny, whimsical cottages. |
| 3 | A pride of [displacer beasts](displacer-beast.md) stalks a band of traveling merchants. The merchants seek protection from the predators hunting them for sport. |
| 4 | A [drider](drider.md) influenced by "Arborea" runs a [giant spider](giant-spider.md) ranch. She hires the characters to hunt a rare breed of [sunfly](sunfly-mpp.md) (detailed "later" in this book) that, when fed to her spiders, will allow them to produce a remarkable type of silk. |
