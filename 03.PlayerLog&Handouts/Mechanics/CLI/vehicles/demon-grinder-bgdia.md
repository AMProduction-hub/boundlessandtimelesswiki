# Demon Grinder
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 219*  

A Demon Grinder is a bulky, armored coach that rumbles loudly as it crushes obstacles and enemies in its path with the help of a swinging wrecking ball. Iron jaws are mounted on the front of the vehicle, which handles like a garbage truck.

## Traits

**Crushing Wheels.** The Demon Grinder can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature. When it does, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone). If the creature was already [prone](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone), it takes an extra 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage. This trait can't be used against a particular creature more than once each turn.

**Magic Weapons.** The Demon Grinder's weapon attacks are magical.

**Prone Deficiency.** If the Demon Grinder rolls over and falls [prone](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Prone), it can't right itself and is [incapacitated](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) until flipped upright.

## Action Stations

**Helm (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Three-Quarters Cover).** Drive and steer the Demon Grinder.

Any nonmagical items the target was holding or carrying are destroyed as well.

**Wrecking Ball (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 40 (`8d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. Double the damage if the target is an object or a structure.
