# Gravity Sinkhole
*4th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a black marble)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A 20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force forms at a point you can see within range and tugs at the creatures there. Each creature in the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `5d10` force damage and is pulled in a straight line toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible (even if that space is in the air). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `d10` for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes**: [Bard](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
