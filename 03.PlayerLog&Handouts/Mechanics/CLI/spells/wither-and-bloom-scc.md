# Wither and Bloom
*2nd-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a withered vine twisted into a loop)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You invoke both death and life upon a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. Each creature of your choice in that area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking `2d6` necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Nonmagical vegetation in that area withers.

In addition, one creature of your choice in that area can spend and roll one of its unspent Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `d6` for each slot above the 2nd, and the number of Hit Dice that can be spent and added to the healing roll increases by one for each slot above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Bard](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight.md); [Druid](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Wizard](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster.md)
