# Wrathful Smite
*1st-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your attack deals an extra `1d6` psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.

**Classes**: [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Warlock (The Hexblade)](list-spells-classes-warlock-the-hexblade-xge.md "subclass=XGE")
