# Eyescratch
*Adventuring gear, poison (contact)*  


- **Properties**: [Poison](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Poison)

A creature that comes into contact with this poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour and [blinded](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) while [poisoned](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way. A [lesser restoration](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or similar magic ends the effect.
