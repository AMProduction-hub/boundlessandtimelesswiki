# Stonky's ring
*Ring (requires attunement)*  



While wearing this ring, you can cast the [telekinesis](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/telekinesis.md) spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren't being worn or carried.

Any character who attunes to the ring gains control of Stonky's creations, though the [skitterwidgets](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/skitterwidget-cm.md) ignore commands spoken more than 30 feet away from them.
