# Danoth's Visor (Dormant)
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/items/img/danoths-visor.webp#right)

- **Properties**: Vestige of Divergence

These mithral-frame goggles with clear diamond lenses were used by the evoker Danoth Oro to spot [invisible](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) enemies and scout areas from afar.

## Dormant

While wearing the goggles in their dormant state, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence ([Investigation](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) and Wisdom ([Perception](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.
