# Sled Dog
*Mount*  


- **Cost**: 50 gp

A sled dog (use the [wolf](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/wolf.md) stat block in appendix A of the Monster Manual) costs 50 gp and can pull 360 pounds.

Sled dogs must take a short rest after pulling a sled for 1 hour; otherwise, they gain one level of [exhaustion](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion).
