# Black Sap
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 300 gp

This tarry substance harvested from the dark boughs of the death's head willow is a powerful intoxicant. It can be smoked as a concentrate or injected directly into the bloodstream. A creature subjected to a dose of black sap cannot be [charmed](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Frightened) for `d6` hours.

For each dose of black sap consumed, a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for `2d4` hours—an effect that is cumulative with multiple doses.
