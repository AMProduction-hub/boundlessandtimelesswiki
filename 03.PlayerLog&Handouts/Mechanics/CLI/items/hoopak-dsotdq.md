A hoopak is a sturdy stick with a sling at one end and a pointed tip at the other.

## Special

When you make a melee attack with this weapon, you ignore its ammunition property. You can use the hoopak as a martial ranged weapon. If you do, it uses the ammunition property, uses sling bullets, and deals `d4` bludgeoning damage on a hit.
