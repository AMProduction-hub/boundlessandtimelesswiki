# The Incantations of Iriolarthas
*Adventuring gear*  
![](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/items/img/the-incantations-of-iriolarthas.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

The Incantations of Iriolarthas is a weighty spellbook. Its black leather covers have dead, toothy worms glued to them, sheathed in glossy varnish. Set into this morbid display on the front cover is a gold rune that resembles a stylized eye with a pupil shaped like a candle flame—the sigil of Iriolarthas, a Netherese lich.

The book contains sixty pages of brittle yellow vellum. Written on these pages are the following wizard spells:
