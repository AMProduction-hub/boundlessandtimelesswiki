# Assassin's Blood
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)*  


- **Properties**: [Poison](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 150 gp

A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6 (`d12`) poison damage and is [poisoned](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't [poisoned](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned).
