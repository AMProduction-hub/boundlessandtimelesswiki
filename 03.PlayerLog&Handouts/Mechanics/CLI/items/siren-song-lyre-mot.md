# Siren Song Lyre
*Wondrous item, instrument, rare (requires attunement)*  



You can use an action to play this lyre and cast one of the following spells from it: [animal friendship](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/animal-friendship.md), [charm person](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/charm-person.md), [enthrall](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/enthrall.md), [suggestion](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion.md). If the spell requires a saving throw, the spell save DC is 13.

Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
