# Shield of Shouting
*Armor ([shield](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/items/shield.md))*  


- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

A [detect magic](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around this shield, which has a minor magical property: words spoken by the shield's bearer are amplified and sound ten times louder than normal.
