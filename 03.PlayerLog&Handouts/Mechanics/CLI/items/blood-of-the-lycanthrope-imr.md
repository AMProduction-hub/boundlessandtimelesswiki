# Blood of the Lycanthrope
*Poison (injury)*  


- **Properties**: [Poison](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Poison)

This poison is created from blood harvested from a dead or [incapacitated](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) lycanthrope in its animal or hybrid form. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with lycanthropy (see the Monster Manual). The curse lasts until removed by the [remove curse](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic.

The type of lycanthropy depends on the lycanthrope used to create the poison. To determine the type of lycanthropy randomly, roll a `d6`:

`dice: [](blood-of-the-lycanthrope-imr.md#^lycanthropy)`

| dice: d6 | Lycanthropy |
|----------|-------------|
| 1-3 | [Wererat](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/wererat.md) |
| 4-5 | [Werewolf](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/werewolf.md) |
| 6 | [Wereboar](03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/wereboar.md) |
