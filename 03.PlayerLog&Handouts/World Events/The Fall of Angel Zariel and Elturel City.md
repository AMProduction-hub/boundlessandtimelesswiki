# **[[The Fall of Angel Zariel and Elturel City]]**

> _"An angel of light, now a queen of Hell. A city of mortals, dragged into Avernus. The war between devils and demons has no end—only new victims."_

The Blood War has raged since the dawn of time, but **one woman’s fall** changed everything.

Long ago, **Zariel** was an angel of Celestia, a warrior devoted to eradicating demons. She led an army of mortal knights into **Avernus, the first layer of Hell**, determined to **end the Blood War at its source**.

She failed.

- Her army was **massacred**, and she was **captured** by Asmodeus himself.
- Instead of killing her, **Asmodeus made her an offer**—if she wished to continue the war, she could do so, but on his terms.
- Zariel **accepted** and was **reborn as an archdevil**, replacing Bel as ruler of Avernus.

But the true horror came **centuries later**, when she sought more souls for her war.

- **Elturel, a holy city**, made a pact with Hell, believing it was merely a blessing to defend against undead.
- The pact’s hidden cost? The city was **dragged into Avernus**, binding all its souls to Zariel’s war.
- Only through great struggle was Elturel **freed**, but the damage was done.

Now, devils see mortals **as potential soldiers** in the Blood War. And some **mortal cities are vanishing**—possibly bound by pacts they never understood.
