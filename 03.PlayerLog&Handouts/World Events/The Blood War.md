# **The Blood War: An Eternal Struggle Between Chaos and Tyranny**

_"The Blood War is the keystone of the cosmos. Should it ever end, existence itself may follow."_  
— Mordenkainen, _The Balance of Power_

## **Origins of the Blood War**

No one knows when the Blood War began, for its battles predate mortal memory, recorded only in the ancient scripts of planar scholars and the whispered nightmares of the damned. It is the ceaseless, apocalyptic struggle between the **devils of the Nine Hells (Baator)** and the **demons of the Abyss**, a war fought not for conquest, but for survival and dominion over the very essence of evil.

While many theorists speculate on its origins, the most widely accepted belief is that the Blood War erupted when the first devils of Baator sought to impose order upon the ever-growing chaos of the Abyss. The demons, beings of pure anarchy and destruction, could not abide such rigid control, and so war erupted—a war without mercy, peace, or end.

## **The Opposing Forces**

### **The Legions of Baator (Devils – Lawful Evil)**

The devils of the Nine Hells are creatures of rigid hierarchy, bound by **contracts, duty, and unyielding law**. Their war against the demons is one of **strategic dominance**, conducted like a massive, ever-expanding campaign of attrition.

- Led by the **Archdevils of the Nine Hells**, with **Asmodeus** as their supreme ruler, the devils employ **legions of disciplined soldiers**, infernal war engines, and careful manipulation to ensure their enemies never gain the upper hand.

- They view the Abyss as an **existential threat to all existence**—if left unchecked, the demons would consume and destroy all reality, plunging everything into infinite, mindless chaos.

- Devils prefer **order, discipline, and control**, and see their war as a **necessity**, not just for their survival but for the **stability of the multiverse**.


### **The Hordes of the Abyss (Demons – Chaotic Evil)**

The demons of the Abyss, in contrast, are creatures of **pure destruction, madness, and unrestrained power**. To them, there is no strategy beyond the next slaughter, no loyalty beyond what serves their own immediate hunger.

- Led by **Demon Lords** such as **Demogorgon, Orcus, and Graz’zt**, the Abyssal legions are **endless waves of ravenous horrors**, each seeking to consume, mutate, or destroy all that stands in their way.

- They do not care for control or stability—**their war against the devils is one of sheer obliteration**. If the Abyss were to win, it is said that all existence would be reduced to a churning mass of endless carnage.

- Some demons fight for power, some for chaos, but most fight because **it is in their nature to do so**.


## **The Battlefields of Eternity**

The Blood War rages across countless planes, but its **primary battlefield** is the **River Styx**, the dark and accursed river that flows between Hell and the Abyss. Armies clash along its banks, entire **planar strongholds rise and fall within hours**, and the water itself is filled with the souls of the eternally damned.

- Some battles are fought on the **plains of Avernus**, the first layer of Hell, where devils hold the line against the relentless demonic invasions.

- Other battles take place deep within the **layered madness of the Abyss**, where devils conduct surgical strikes to destabilize their foes.

- The Blood War spills over into the Material Plane when **powerful warlocks, cults, or unlucky mortals** become entangled in the schemes of fiendish generals.


## **The Role of Mortals**

For all their power, both devils and demons seek **mortal influence**. Mortals bring **souls, resources, and unpredictable ingenuity**, which can turn the tide of war.

- **Devils seek contracts and pacts**, offering power, knowledge, or salvation in exchange for eternal service.

- **Demons corrupt and destroy**, twisting mortals into mindless pawns or demonic horrors to bolster their ranks.

- Some mortal factions, such as the **Hellsworn Orders** or **Abyssal Cults**, actively serve one side or the other, either as **soldiers, spies, or arcane suppliers**.


## **The Blood War’s Impact on the Multiverse**

Though its battles rarely reach the mortal world, the consequences of the Blood War are **felt across the planes**:

- The Nine Hells remain **militarized and fortified**, forcing devils to expand their ranks through soul contracts.

- The Abyss continuously **spawns new horrors**, some of which break free from the war and plague other realms.

- The **celestial forces of good**, particularly the gods of law and justice, refuse to intervene directly, as they believe that if one side were to truly win, **a greater catastrophe might unfold**.


Some scholars theorize that **the Blood War is a necessary evil**, preventing fiends from turning their full attention toward **the conquest of the mortal world**. Others believe it is **a trap**, orchestrated by Asmodeus or an unknown force, to keep both factions locked in an eternal conflict while something far worse lurks in the shadows.

One thing remains certain: **the Blood War will never end.** It has raged for eons before the first mortal kingdom was built, and it will continue long after the last mortal breathes their final words.
