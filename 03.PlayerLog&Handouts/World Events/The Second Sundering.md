# **[[The Second Sundering]]**

> _The world shook, the gods fell silent, and the planes themselves were reshaped. Ao was not done rewriting the cosmos."_

The Spellplague (1385 DR) had thrown the multiverse into disarray. The Weave of Magic was shattered, and entire **realms were lost**. But centuries later, Ao acted again.

- **The gods were briefly cut off from their followers**—a second divine crisis.
- Lost deities, like **Lathander, Mask, and Mystra**, **returned**, as if Ao had rewritten existence.
- The Sundering **restructured the planes**, making the cosmic fabric more stable—but also more rigid.

Some **scholars whisper** that Ao’s true goal was not merely to repair reality, but to **test his authority** over it.
