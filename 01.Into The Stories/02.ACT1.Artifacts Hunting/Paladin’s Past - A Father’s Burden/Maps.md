### 🗺️ **Landmarks of Aruendel**
---
#### 🏞️ **1. Danau Estara**

_("Lake Estara")_  
A mist-covered lake in a remote corner of Aruendel. This is where the **Pequod** lands and marks the players’ entry point to the plane. The lake has calm, almost too-still waters, and locals say it was once sacred—touched by celestial magic long ago.

> ✦ Used by the Bureau for discreet planar landings.

---
#### 🌾 **2. Lembah Moondell**

_("Moondell Valley")_  
A peaceful, fertile valley with scattered farms and a sleepy hamlet. The **Paladin and his daughter** travel here frequently, selling bread and pastries. The people here are kind, but superstition about dark forces still lingers.

> ✦ Possible encounter: An old woman recognizes the paladin.

---
#### 🌲 **3. Hutan Harlowe**

_("Harlowe Wood")_  
A dense forest bordering Moondell. It holds **lingering magical scars** from the war 30 years ago. At night, some claim to hear whispers and see half-formed shapes drifting among the trees.

> ✦ Occasional wildlife attacks. Strong illusion magic residue. ✦ Possible Bureau visual marker hidden in a stone circle.

---
#### 🏰 **4. Benteng Caerthwyn**

_("Caerthwyn Keep")_  
A ruined fort at the edge of the hills. Once a stronghold of one of the noble houses, it was abandoned after its lord was revealed to have used forbidden magic. Now it’s half-swallowed by vines and time.

> ✦ Dark magic remnants. ✦ Could be used as a cult hideout or secret lair.

---
#### 🐦 **5. Tebing Merak**

_("Peacock Cliffs")_  
Tall, dramatic cliffs near the coast where ravens and other black birds roost. It's said that **ravens watch all from here**, and it’s not uncommon to see one following travelers.

> ✦ Raven foreshadowing the Mother. ✦ A place for a vision or dream if players sleep nearby.

---
#### 🔮 **6. Lingkaran Nyx**

_("Nyx's Ring")_  
A ruined arcane circle hidden in the northern hills. It was part of the last stand against the dark magic cult. The land here is scarred, and sometimes raw magic seeps through the soil.

> ✦ Could subtly react to the amulet when the daughter is near.

---
#### 🛤️ **7. Jalan Tua Pelgrane**

_("Pelgrane Old Road")_  
An old merchant trail that connects several of these locations. It is now mostly overgrown, with broken waystones and mossy milestones. Quiet, but still walkable.

> ✦ Bandits are rare, but traces of ancient skirmishes remain.
