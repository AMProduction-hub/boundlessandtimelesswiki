# 🌍 Aruendel - Peaceful Land with a Buried Past  
_"The war was thirty winters past, but the land remembers its wounds."_  

## **🌟 Introduction**  
- **Tone & Theme:** A quaint, storybook realm recovering from a magical war. Peaceful on the surface, but cracks show where old powers once clashed.  
- **Artifact Location:** The Daughter’s Amulet (imbued with purified raw magic, resonates with Nyx’s Ring).  
- **Primary Conflict:** Players must retrieve the artifact, but doing so means risking the bond between the paladin and his daughter. The artifact awakens old powers and draws interest from a shadowy figure.  
- **Moral Dilemma:** Do they take the amulet by force or find a way to part the father and daughter peacefully? Will they reveal the Bureau’s goals to them?

## **📜 Poetic Introduction (Read to Players on Arrival)**  
*"Upon a still and hallowed lake they land,  
Where fog clings soft to memory and moss.  
The bread is warm, the days are kind,  
Yet ravens perch where magic’s cost was high."*

## **🗺️ Major Locations**

### 🏞️ 1. Danau Estara *(Lake Estara)*  
A misty, tranquil lake. The Pequod lands here—its surface eerily calm. Once touched by celestial powers, now it hides the arrival of Bureau agents.

- ✦ Bureau visual marker on an old stone arch at the shoreline.
- ✦ Setting for the party’s first breath in Aruendel.

### 🌾 2. Lembah Moondell *(Moondell Valley)*  
A sleepy hamlet and fertile farmland. People are kind, but wary of outsiders. Here, the Paladin and his daughter are beloved bread-sellers.

- ✦ Encounter: An old woman recognizes the paladin from his adventuring days.
- ✦ Subtle rumors: some whisper the daughter has “the glow” of magic.

### 🌲 3. Hutan Harlowe *(Harlowe Wood)*  
Dark, whispering woods. Illusion magic scars the forest. Shapes flicker at the edge of sight.

- ✦ Strange sounds and half-seen figures by night.
- ✦ A Bureau visual marker hidden in a ring of stones.
- ✦ Animal attacks possible if provoked.

### 🏰 4. Benteng Caerthwyn *(Caerthwyn Keep)*  
Ruins of a fallen noble house that used dark magic to end the war. Twisted remnants remain—arcane echoes and malevolent residue.

- ✦ Possible cult hideout or confrontation site.
- ✦ Glimpses of the mother’s influence may be found here (e.g., a sigil she once used).

### 🐦 5. Tebing Merak *(Peacock Cliffs)*  
Cliffs where ravens nest. A raven may follow the party from here, especially once the daughter’s powers begin to awaken.

- ✦ Site of vision/dream if players rest here.
- ✦ Foreshadowing of the mother—watching through the raven.

### 🔮 6. Lingkaran Nyx *(Nyx’s Ring)*  
A collapsed arcane site, the scene of the last stand against the cult. Now overgrown and quiet—but not dead.

- ✦ The amulet glows/reacts here if the daughter is near.
- ✦ May trigger memories, whispers, or even contact with ancient echoes.

### 🛤️ 7. Jalan Tua Pelgrane *(Pelgrane Old Road)*  
An ancient road, moss-covered and mostly forgotten. Connects the other locations.

- ✦ Quiet travel, but signs of long-past skirmishes linger.
- ✦ Perfect spot for a random magical anomaly or discovery.
