```admonition

```
A once-glorious paladin who has renounced his sword now lives in exile as a merchant, protecting his daughter — a young sorcerer whose powers manifested unexpectedly. Unbeknownst to her, the amulet she wears is one of the Bureau's sought-after artifacts. 

Her mother, a powerful noble agent and former lover of the paladin, wants her child back — but not out of affection. She sees the girl as a political weapon and a key to restoring magical power for her faction. The country still fears magic after a disastrous magical coup 30 years ago. The girl is caught between duty, love, and awakening power.

### 🪜 Narrative Beats (Use These as DM Flow Anchors)

#### I. Arrival in the Town of **Eledar's Reach**
- This sleepy, post-crisis border town feels tense. Anti-magic posters are posted on walls.
- Whispers of "the mage child" have been heard. Locals are cautious.
- Players are here to investigate a *"radiant artifact giving rise to uncontrolled sorcery."*

> *Visual prompt*: “An old church turned into a tradehouse. Its windows stained with sun motifs, now dulled by smoke. People avoid it — and those inside.”

#### II. Meeting the Merchant
- **Thalric**, the ex-paladin, greets players cordially.
- He offers no information unless pressed.
- If they ask about the girl, he becomes protective, lying if needed.

> 🗨️ *Thalric (guarded):* “She’s just a girl who reads too much and glows too bright. That doesn’t make her a threat.”

> 🗨️ *Thalric (if pressured):* “Once, I believed the gods spoke through the sword. Now I keep it buried... for her sake.”

#### III. Discovery of the Amulet
- The girl wears a pendant with faint golden veins — a magical signature.
- A simple **Detect Magic** or **Arcana** shows it radiates *dimensional/chronal magic*.
- She says, “Papa gave it to me when I was born. I feel safe when I hold it.”

> 🧠 *DM Note*: Don’t overplay this. Let players piece together its importance.

#### IV. Mother Arrives with a Noble Task Force
- **Lady Evandrine** arrives in a magically sealed carriage, escorted by knights and masked mages.
- She demands her daughter be returned. If refused, she *invokes noble rights* under the local anti-magic laws.

> 🗨️ *Evandrine (coldly):* “I raised this girl in my womb. I will raise her again as the dawn of a new age.”

> 🗨️ *Evandrine (to Thalric):* “You think love makes you her father? No. Legacy does.”

#### V. Choices & Escalation
- Players must choose:
  - **Help Thalric and his daughter escape**, violating local law.
  - **Hand over the girl**, satisfying political stability but endangering her freedom.
  - **Negotiate** (hard DC, multiple checks) — but time is short.

> 🧠 *DM Tip*: Track player tone: do they prioritize the girl, the artifact, or stability?

#### VI. Conflict or Chase (Depending on Choice)
- If players resist, **combat** or **escape scene** breaks out.
- If the girl runs, she may **awaken a new sorcerer ability**, blasting an entire street by accident.

> 🔥 *DM Flavor*: “The amulet pulses — and the sky flickers like pages turning. Her cry isn’t heard. It’s remembered.”

---

### 🎯 Key Goals
- **Establish moral grayness** (both parents have motives).
- Highlight the **artifact’s cost** — it grants power, but at a steep price.
- Reveal the **political tension** around magic.
- Let players **shape the girl’s future** (and possibly gain her as an ally or enemy).

---

### 🧶 Loose End Threads for Later
- If rescued, the girl might join the Bureau later — or become corrupted.
- If handed over, Evandrine may rise in political power.
- The artifact might react differently depending on who holds it next.
- Thalric’s past with the Bureau can be referenced by Shaperite in later acts.

Back in the Grand Library, Shaperite asks:

> *“A father gave up everything to protect her. Would you do the same? The artifact radiates because it was loved — not wielded. That’s rare.”*
