# ADAM

## Overview

ADAM is HAWA’s silent counterpart — an executioner, investigator, and contingency made flesh. Where HAWA governs Barovia through doctrine and structure, ADAM enforces it through inevitability.

He is a dhampir born during the final decades of Strahd’s rule, trained from youth to hunt his own kind. To the common folk, ADAM is a rumor. To vampires, he is proof that coexistence has teeth.

ADAM does not debate morality.  
He executes conclusions.

To the players, ADAM feels like someone who has already **decided how this ends** — and is merely watching to see if they surprise him.

## Plot Web

- **Selûnite Execution Warden**
    
    - Acts as final enforcement of HAWA’s decrees.
    - Conducts silent removals, disappearances, and “necessary deaths.”
    - Never acts without authorization — except once.

- **Vampire Countermeasure**
    
    - Specialized in tracking elder vampires and blood cults.
    - Immune to most charm and domination effects.
    - Keeps detailed kill-ledgers, not trophies.

- **Artifact Proximity Agent**
    
    - Aware of the **Deep Purple Netherese Stone**, but deliberately uninformed of its full nature.
    - His orders are simple: if containment fails, eliminate variables.
    - Included among those variables: the players, if required.

- **Relationship to HAWA**
    
    - Absolute loyalty, not emotional dependence.
    - Will kill her if Barovia’s stability requires it.
    - Accepts her judgment as final — until it endangers the plane.

## Personal Traits

- Speaks rarely; answers directly.
- Observes more than he intervenes.
- Shows no visible cruelty or pleasure in violence.
- Treats death as an administrative task.
- Has a dry, almost absent sense of humor — revealed only under stress.

---

## Beliefs & Ideology

- Law exists to prevent worse outcomes.
- Mercy is a resource, not a virtue.
- Monsters are defined by action, not nature.
- Hope is dangerous when unguarded.
- Someone must be willing to be hated.

## Key Dialogue Notes

ADAM never gives speeches. His words land because they are few.

> “If this fails, I will end it quickly.”

> “I am not here to convince you.”

> “You are not the first to mean well.”

> “Decisions don’t need witnesses.”

## GM Notes (Hidden)

- ADAM **will lie** if it preserves stability.
- He has already planned contingencies for each PC.
- If the players oppose HAWA openly, ADAM will observe — not intervene.
- If the artifact is removed, ADAM immediately shifts to damage control mode.
- He is fully aware that history will remember him as a monster — and accepts it.
