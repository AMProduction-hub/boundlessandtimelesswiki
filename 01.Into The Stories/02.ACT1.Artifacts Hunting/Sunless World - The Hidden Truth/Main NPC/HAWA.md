# HAWA
## Overview
HAWA is a senior Selûnite cleric operating in Barovia after the fall of [[03.PlayerLog&Handouts/Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/strahd-von-zarovich-cos|Strahd von Zarovich]]. She is one of the architects responsible for stabilizing the domain during the power vacuum left by Strahd’s disappearance.

Unlike most agents of Selûne, HAWA believes that **mercy without control is cruelty deferred**. Her faith manifests not as gentle guidance, but as rigid stewardship — a belief that the moon exists to _govern the night_, not merely illuminate it.

To the people of Barovia, HAWA is remembered as a savior.  
To the vampires who remain, she is a necessary jailer.  
To the players, she is a woman who sounds _uncomfortably correct_.

## Plot Web

- **Selûnite Anchor Warden**
    
    - Oversees the lunar rites sustaining Barovia’s weakened sun.
    - Maintains planar stability through religious and arcane measures.
    - Acts independently from most Faerûnian temples.

- **Post-Strahd Architect**
    
    - Helped prevent a violent collapse following Strahd’s absence.
    - Instituted strict coexistence laws between mortals and vampires.
    - Authorized executions and exile during the early stabilization period.

- **Artifact Custodian (Indirect)**
    
    - Aware of the **Deep Purple Netherese Stone** beneath Castle Ravenloft.
    - Views the artifact as a _necessary containment mechanism_.
    - Will oppose any attempt to remove it without an alternative solution.

- **Relationship to ADAM**
    
    - Relies on ADAM to enforce outcomes she will not personally carry out.
    - Trusts him completely — but knows he would kill her if required.
    - Represents the “voice”; ADAM represents the “hand.”

## Personal Traits

- Speaks calmly, never raises her voice.
- Frames every decision as an act of compassion.
- Deeply distrusts the idea of “exceptional individuals.”
- Genuinely mourns every life lost — including those she orders killed.
- Incapable of seeing herself as a tyrant.

---

## Beliefs & Ideology

- Vampires are **inherently cyclical threats**, regardless of current behavior.
- Peace is not natural — it must be **maintained continuously**.
- Waiting for evil to re-emerge is moral negligence.
- If suffering is inevitable, it should be _minimized and controlled_.

---

## Key Dialogue Notes

Use these sparingly — HAWA should never monologue unless pressed.

> “If not us, then who will carry the burden?”

> “You call this coexistence. I call it a delay.”

> “Evil does not announce itself. It waits until mercy grows tired.”

> “I am not judging them. I am preparing for what they will become.”

## GM Notes (Hidden)

- HAWA **never lies**.
- She genuinely believes the players are capable — but dangerous.
- If the players remove the artifact, she will not stop them by force.
- She _will_ prepare Barovia for the consequences without their consent.
- Her faith in Selûne is sincere, not political.
