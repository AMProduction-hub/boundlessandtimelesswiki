### 🗺️ **Landmarks of Shattar-Kai**
---
#### 🏞️ **1. Sashelas Sea**

The lifeblood of Shattar-Kai. Ships from distant planes come and go, bearing goods, refugees, and sometimes mercenaries. Its tranquil surface hides the scars of sunken warships. Fishermen still cast their nets near the bones of battles.

> 🐙 **Encounter Idea:** A sea kraken mutated by an eldritch presence attempts to breach the Pequod’s hull. Players must help defend the ship while still onboard.

---
#### ⚓ **2. Port of Stalwart**

A walled trade hub tightly controlled by the Stalwart regime. Soldiers inspect every ship, and the Freemen are barred entry. It thrives off Bureau-backed commerce, with underground markets fueled by war profiteering.

> 🗡️ **Encounter Idea:** Players witness a Freeman smuggler caught and publicly executed. A hidden agent begs the party for help escaping the city with crucial intel.

---
#### 🌌 **3. Tunnel of Grim**

Once a booming mithral mine, now a penal colony for criminals, rebels, and debtors. The tunnels are haunted by echoes and madness. Some say ancient spirits lurk beneath—others, something far worse.

> 🕯️ **Dungeon Crawl:** Navigate collapsed shafts, rebel ghost miners, and an ancient entity sealed below. A tunnel leads directly beneath No Man’s Land...

---
#### 🏰 **4. No Man’s Land**

The ravaged heart of Shattar-Kai. Craters, trenches, and broken ballistae fill the terrain. A crumbling bridge connects both sides—its stones stained by generations of failed truces. In its center, a ruined chapel hides the artifact: *Tears of Ymir*.

> 💀 **Encounter Idea:** Both sides launch a surprise assault while players investigate the chapel. Cursed spirits from the first war awaken beneath.

---
#### 🦅 **5. Bastion of Stalwart**

Fortified citadel of the ruling class. Its architecture reflects rigid order and ancestral pride. Within its granite halls, **General Valtan** commands with iron resolve. Here, law is sacred—even when mercy is needed.

> ⚖️ **Encounter Idea:** A Freeman infiltrator is captured. Valtan offers the players a cruel choice: execute the spy or risk him escaping and restarting hostilities.

---
#### 🔥 **6. Freemen Camp**

Tents and wooden walls form this chaotic but hopeful resistance camp. Among songs, cooking fires, and scarred veterans, **Nikael of the Fire Banner** plans the next rebellion. This camp breathes freedom—but bleeds from betrayal.

> 🕊️ **Encounter Idea:** A campfire council debates peace. Players are asked to vote—and their decision will ripple across future acts.

---
#### 🕯️ **7. House of Silence**

Sanctuary of the dead and the neutral. Here, **Father Malen**, a Tiefling seer of Kelemvor, guides lost souls to the Fugue Plane. Its stone halls host ceasefire summits—though no armistice holds for long. Visions here warn of something darker coming.

> 🧠 **Encounter Idea:** Players are shown omens of the Eldritch Horror through a soul-chamber ritual. One PC sees their own death—and must choose whether to tell the party.

---
#### 🎣 **8. House of Fisher**

A coastal settlement of orcish fisherfolk caught in the crossfire. Forced to feed both armies, they hide an underground resistance movement. Both sides suspect sabotage—tensions rise by the tide.

> 🎯 **Encounter Idea:** A Freemen cell hides among the fishers. A Stalwart squad demands their names. Players can lie, stall, or fight to protect the innocents.
