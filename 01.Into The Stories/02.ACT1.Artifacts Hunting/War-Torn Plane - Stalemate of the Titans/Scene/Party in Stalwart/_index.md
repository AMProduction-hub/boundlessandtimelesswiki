## 🎭 Scene: The Stalwart High Society Ball

**Location:** _The Grand Ballroom of the Stalwart Citadel_, lit by hundreds of candles reflecting off golden trim and deep blue banners. The air smells faintly of jasmine wine and expensive perfume. Masked nobility, cloaked officials, and shadowy guests mingle in the music and whispers.

### **Main Attendees & Hooks**

1. **General Valtan** – commanding presence, rarely smiles, here to ensure political stability. He’s in full ceremonial Stalwart uniform with a mask covering only the upper face.
    - **Hook:** Quietly instructs Eric on political decorum, while keeping a sharp eye on his enemies.

2. **Eric Valtan (The Son)** – young, ambitious, but not yet seasoned. Nervous about the night, partly because he suspects the marriage arrangement isn’t as voluntary as it appears.
    - **Hook:** Could privately ask the players for advice or help slipping away.

3. **Envoy Valtan (General’s Brother)** – suave, silver-tongued, mingles with nobles and oligarchs like a fish in water.
    - **Hook:** Has personal stake in solidifying peace — might offer the players bribes or side-quests for information.

4. **The Council Members** – political heavyweights; they debate quietly in alcoves, whispering about troop movements and trade agreements.

5. **Oligarch Families** – each has their own masked heirs and rivals, spreading rumors like wildfire.
    - **Hook:** Players can overhear or insert themselves to learn hidden agendas.

6. **Ember (Leader of the Local Thieves Guild)** – wearing a crimson fox mask, moves between shadows and nobles, probably running side deals.
    - **Hook:** Offers illicit intel in exchange for favors.

7. **Damian** – charismatic, leaning on balcony rails, wine glass in hand. A man who knows everyone and owes no one.
    - **Hook:** Gives cryptic “pointers” about the political game, but mostly here for the drama.

8. **Sofia (Nikael’s Sister)** – radiant in desert-inspired finery with a Stalwart twist, a political guest of honor.
    - **Hook:** The _real_ center of the night’s tension — her betrothal to Eric is meant to cement the truce, but both sides have enemies that want this peace to fail.

### **Core Conflict**

The betrothal announcement between **Sofia** and **Eric** is planned for the evening.

- **Pro-peace factions** want it to go smoothly.
- **Anti-peace factions** aim to sabotage it — possibly sparking an incident that will collapse the ceasefire.

### **Possible Player Engagement**

- **Mask & Disguise Mechanics** – like the Dragon Age "Court Approval" system, players can win or lose favor by conversation, behavior, and subtle actions.
- **Rumor Collection** – talking to certain NPCs or eavesdropping can reveal hidden plots.
- **Tension Choices** – do the players support the union, sabotage it, or turn it to their faction’s advantage?
- **Secret Duel or Confrontation** – perhaps in a garden, masked so identities are concealed.
- **Misdirection Events** – stolen documents, poisoned wine, or a missing guest the players must find before the announcement.

### **Ending Possibilities**

1. **Union Secured** – the peace holds… for now.
2. **Union Broken** – war drums will sound in the morning.
3. **Union Redirected** – perhaps Sofia or Eric chooses another path, and the players decide who benefits.
