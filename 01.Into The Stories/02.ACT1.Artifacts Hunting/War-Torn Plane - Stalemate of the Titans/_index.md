# 🌍 Shattar-Kai – The War-Torn Ideal  
_"Steel grinds on ideals and blood stains every flag. This is a land where conviction outlives reason."_  

## **🌟 Introduction**  
- **Tone & Theme:** Tragic idealism, wartime paranoia, and the slow erosion of hope. A grim plane locked in endless war between two sides who’ve forgotten how to stop.  
- **Artifact Location:** Shards of the Pact-Stone (Embedded in a ceremonial vault at the Broken Line Citadel, hidden under a ceasefire monument).  
- **Primary Conflict:**  
  A long-standing civil war where no side is truly evil, just irreconcilable. One side ("The Stalwarts") has traditions, structure, and deep political history. The other ("The Freemen") are veterans and idealists who rejected that system long ago.  
- **Moral Dilemma:**  
  No side offers peace. Players must decide if they’ll try to end the war, pick a side to favor, or simply claim the artifact and leave. Their actions shift the final outcome—and the horror it awakens.  

## **📜 Poetic Introduction (Read to Players on Arrival)**  
> _“The banners hang like funeral shrouds in the windless sky. The mud is churned with blood that remembers yesterday. And every face you see is older than it should be.”_  
> *Bendera-bendera menggantung seperti kain kafan pemakaman di langit yang tak berangin. Tanah bergolak dengan darah yang mengingat masa lampau. Dan setiap wajah yang engkau lihat terlihat lebih tua dari yang seharusnya*

📖 *Inspired by Wilfred Owen’s "Futility" and W. B. Yeats’ “The Second Coming.”*

## **🗺️ Major Locations**  

- **🛡️ Bastion of Stalwarts**  
  - White marble towers scorched black by decades of siege fire.  
  - NPCs: Commander Kalbreen (half-elf diplomat-general), Lord Gysar (paranoid noble).  
  - Secrets: They want peace only if they can keep their rule. Have secret dealings to offer safe passage in exchange for help in negotiating a last pact.  

- **🔥 Camp of the Freemen**  
  - Tattered tents surrounded by makeshift watchfires. Full of idealists, veterans, and those who lost everything.  
  - NPCs: Sera Vann (orcish field medic), Captain Jarn (scarred warrior-poet), child messengers delivering truth and morale.  
  - Secrets: They don’t know their leaders plan a final charge—even at the cost of their people’s survival.  

- **🕊️ Ceasefire Monument / Vault of Silence**  
  - Hidden vault beneath a neutral memorial, where the artifact rests.  
  - The location is neutral ground, but unstable. Guarded by spirits of those who once believed peace was possible.  
  - Hints of past Bureau involvement—symbols from Time And Plane scratched into the base of the stone.

## **🦠 Major NPCs**

- **Damian**  
  - Assigned to negotiate, but his true role is manipulative observer. Speaks like Ocelot—maddeningly cryptic, always two steps ahead.  
  - Says things like:  
    - _“A truce is only a pause in the next betrayal.”_  
    - _“What do you *think* you’re saving?”_  
  - Watch out: The longer players listen to him, the more he bends their logic. Bureau warns: **“Do not speak with him unless necessary.”**

- **Shatterling** *(Post-Summoning NPC)*  
  - A former priest of peace who summons the eldritch horror in despair.  
  - Role: The Herald of Collapse.  
  - Dialogue (final words):  
    > _“All of this was for *ideals*. And they rot in silence. Let the void swallow your justice.”_

## **🎭 Encounters & Challenges**

- **✴️ Factional Influence Puzzle:**  
  - Over 3 key acts (missions, negotiations, moral choices), players tilt the balance of war.  
  - Winning a side’s favor grants support to reach the artifact vault.  
  - The side losing favor becomes desperate—leading to a tragic surrender or final suicidal charge.

- **🗡️ Ceasefire Vault Trial:**  
  - Artifact is behind a psychic memory trial: players experience scenes of peace negotiations failing again and again.  
  - Puzzle: Reconstruct one historical peace using three provided scenes. Success opens the vault. Failure awakens wrathful spirits.

- **🌌 Eldritch Minion Encounter (Plane’s Collapse):**  
  - Triggered after the final event when the horror is summoned.
  - **See separate encounter file**: “Run from the Howling Root”  
  - Goal: Survive & retreat to the ship. Damage or deaths during escape add narrative weight at the Bureau.

## **📜 Conclusion & Next Steps**

- **If Players Flee Successfully:**  
  - Shaperite teleports in with the Four Musicians of Time.  
  - He holds off the horror, sacrifices greatly. (Loses his eye.)  
  - Players bring the shards back to the Bureau, now marked with corruption.  

- **At the Bureau:**  
  - Grand Library is silent. Pustakawan watches over Shaperite.  
  - She says only:  
    > _“We give so much to hold the line. You saw what happens when the line breaks.”_

- **Effect on the Blood War:**  
  - The horror’s brief emergence causes a planar ripple. Devils and demons grow agitated. Sigil factions grow concerned.  
  - Bureau accelerates its efforts to retrieve the remaining artifacts.
