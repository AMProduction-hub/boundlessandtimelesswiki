# 🌍 Shattar-Kai - War-Torn Plane of Fractured Ideals  
_"In lands where peace once reigned, only flags of war remain. The soil remembers every oath broken, every brother lost."_  

## **🌟 Introduction**  
- **Tone & Theme:** A battlefield frozen in ideology. Two factions—one hardened by time, the other dream-worn and raw—clash endlessly.  
- **Artifact Location:** Purple Stones (Hidden beneath the ruins in No Man’s Land, sealed inside a forgotten chapel of the Raven Queen)  
- **Primary Conflict:** The Freemen, a coalition of idealistic rebels, fight to establish a new order. The Stalwart Kingdom defends a crumbling status quo.  
- **Moral Dilemma:** Players must choose whom to support—idealistic rebels who risk chaos, or a lawful but stagnating kingdom. Each decision shifts the power on the battlefield.  

## **📜 Poetic Introduction (Read to Players on Arrival)**  
_"We are born to bury our fathers' wars, and yet we dig new graves in old trenches."_  
— Inspired by Wilfred Owen & Siegfried Sassoon  

Pequod slows to a halt. Ashen skies loom over the sea, and the coastline reeks of smoke and dried blood. Ahead lies **Port of Stalwart**, where the Queen’s banner still flutters, tattered but defiant. Behind enemy lines, drums beat from the **Freemen Camp**, echoing over the trenches of **No Man’s Land**. A storm brews not only in the sky—but in the soul of this plane.

## **🗺️ Major Locations**  
- **⚔️ Bastion of Stalwart** – Fortified city of stone and doctrine. Home to the old guard, ruled by General Valtan, weary of war but unwilling to bend.  
- **🏕️ Freemen Camp** – A camp of outcasts, dreamers, and survivors led by Nikael, a former Stalwart captain turned rebel.  
- **⚰️ No Man’s Land** – Scarred land riddled with broken siege engines, trenches, and cursed spirits. Holds the hidden chapel where the **Tears of Ymir** lie.  
- **🏚️ House of Silence** – A neutral asylum for deserters and seers. Whispers of prophecy and madness echo here.  
- **🏛️ House of Fisher** – Merchant guild who feeds both sides, secretly dealing in war relics and old magic.  
- **🛶 Port of Stalwart** – Bureau’s chosen entry point. Technically neutral but heavily watched.  

## **🦠 Major NPCs**  
- **Damian (Cambion)** – Disguised as a diplomat for the Bureau, he arrives “coincidentally” after players land. His silver tongue influences all sides—intentionally or not.  
- **General Valtan (Human, Lawful Neutral)** – Proud leader of Bastion. Believes in order, law, and lineage. Desperate to preserve the realm without yielding.  
- **Nikael of the Fire Banner (Half-Elf, Chaotic Good)** – Wounded idealist, believes peace must be earned by shattering corrupt thrones.  
- **Father Malen (Tiefling Seer)** – Keeper of the House of Silence. Cryptic, feared. Knows what the **Tears of Ymir** truly are.  

## **🎭 Encounters & Challenges**  
- **Negotiation Acts** – Players can join military meetings, protect diplomats, or lead skirmishes. Each action gives favor to one side.  
- **No Man’s Land Crawl** – Dangerous trench warfare across spirit-infested zones. Undead of both factions haunt the ground.  
- **Eldritch Surge (Final Act)** – When one faction loses too many player favors, their zealots summon an **Eldritch Horror** in desperation. The summoner dies as the **Tears of Ymir** are consumed to awaken the creature.  
- **Damian’s Offer** – In secret, Damian offers a shortcut to recover the artifact early, but with mysterious costs.  
- **Stage Mini-Bosses:**  
  - **Ash Revenant** – CR 5 undead soldier bound to battlefield oath.  
  - **Void Howler** – CR 6 aberration that warps memory. Introduces horror tone before the final boss.  

## **📜 Conclusion & Next Steps**  
- **Players Retreat** – The horror grows. The **Musicians of Time** arrive with Shaperite to delay its advance. A theatrical rock opera battle ensues as players rush to the Pequod.  
- **Aftermath** – Back at the Grand Library, Shaperite lies unconscious, missing his left eye. Pustakawan watches over him, and the Bureau is shaken by the horror’s awakening.  
- **Effect on Bureau:** Trust in the Bureau fractures. Whispers of their manipulation begin to circulate. Damian, once considered an agent, is now a wildcard.
