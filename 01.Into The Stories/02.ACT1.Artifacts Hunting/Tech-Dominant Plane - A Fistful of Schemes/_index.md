# 🌍 The Frontier of Shifting Sands - ⌛ Cowboy Temporal Plane  
_"A land where time stumbles, where the magic of the gods has burned away,  
and only grit, gears, and gunpowder remain. Yet the air crackles —  
for something old and broken here still ticks against eternity."_  

---

## **🌟 Introduction**  
- **Tone & Theme:** Pulp Western meets temporal anomalies. Think *Indiana Jones* with a cowboy hat, *Back to the Future 3*’s chaotic inventions, and a touch of weird science.  
- **Artifact Location:** The Bureau agent already possesses the **Chrono-Engine Core** (artifact).  
- **Primary Conflict:** The artifact destabilizes teleportation; the party must recover a rare part from a train shipment to escape.  
- **Moral Dilemma:** Do the PCs engage in outlaw hijinks, side with anyone (gangs, rail baron), or try to solve things peacefully in the middle of a robbery gone wrong?

## **📜 Poetic Introduction (Read to Players on Arrival)**  
*"Dust storms roll across the plains, swirling through a town of warped clocks and broken machines.  
The air tastes dry — dead of magic — yet every step hums with unseen sparks.  
From the saloon’s porch, a train whistle howls across the horizon,  
its echo carrying both promise… and doom."*

- **🔬 The Gnome’s Workshop**  
  - Bureau Agent **Professor Tinkwhistle**, eccentric artificer. Ramshackle lab stuffed with broken gears, glowing coils, and chalkboards filled with nonsense math.

## **🦠 Major NPCs**  
- **Professor Tinkwhistle (Gnome Artificer, Bureau Agent)**  
  - **Role:** Quest-giver, comic relief, but holds the artifact.  
  - **Motivation:** Repair his teleporter, complete his mission.  
  - **Key Dialogue:** *“Without that coil, we’re as stranded as a cactus in a sandstorm!”*  

- **Baron Blackthorn (Human Rail Baron, Villain)**  
  - **Role:** Antagonist, owns the Focusing Coil.  
  - **Motivation:** Greed, monopoly of frontier trade, crushing all resistance.  
  - **Key Dialogue:** *“This land runs on steel and steam, and I own both.”*  

- **The Red Vultures (Outlaw Gang 1)**  
  - Flashy desperadoes with red dusters. They want gold from the train.  
  - May ally briefly if PCs join their raid.

- **Skill Challenges:** Convincing townsfolk, fixing Tinkwhistle’s devices, learning about the train.  
- **Train Heist Setpiece:**  
  - Gangs, guards, and glitches collide.

  - Temporal anomalies during fight: enemies duplicate, time skips, glimpses of Damian/Ao in visions.  

- **Key Choices:**  
  - Do they take sides with gangs, or fight both?  
  - Do they kill or negotiate with the Baron?  
  - Do they use the artifact’s unstable power in the heist (risking paradox)?
