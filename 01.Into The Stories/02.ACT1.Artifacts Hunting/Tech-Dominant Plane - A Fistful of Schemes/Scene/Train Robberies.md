# 🚂 Train Heist Timeline – Frontier of Shifting Sands  

## 🎬 Phase 1: Boarding the Train  
- **Scene Setup:** The Trans-Frontier Express roars across the plains, smoke rising against the red sunset. Outlaws converge on horseback while guards patrol the rooftops of the train cars.  
- **Player Entry Options:**  
  - Sneak in from the desert (stealth / disguise).  
  - Join a gang’s assault wave.  
  - Go loud: frontal charge or “concert distraction.”  
- **Complication:** Temporal glitch — the train whistle echoes twice, the same moment replayed. PCs see “ghost selves” repeating actions for a second.

## 🔥 Phase 2: Chaos on the Rails  
- **Escalation:** Both gangs hit the train at the same time. Red Vultures climb the cars with ropes; Cinder Snakes blast explosives at the rear.  
- **Combat/Challenges:**  
  - PCs must deal with guards, rival gangs, or the unstable terrain.  
  - Outlaws may offer alliances (“Help us crack the safe, you get a cut”).  
  - Time rift anomaly:  
    - Enemy suddenly splits into two versions.  
    - Gun misfires release sparks of raw magic.  
    - PCs glimpse a flash of Damian/Ao’s voices in the desert wind.  
- **Objective:** Reach the armored vault car holding the **Focusing Coil**.

## ⚡ Phase 3: The Vault & Temporal Collapse  
- **Climax Setup:** Inside the armored car, Baron Blackthorn confronts the PCs (and whoever survived).  
- **Choices:**  
  - Fight him & his elite guards.  
  - Intimidate / negotiate a handover.  
  - Use the artifact’s unstable resonance to force the vault open (risk paradox!).  
- **Temporal Twist:**  
  - The artifact destabilizes as the coil is removed.  
  - Train derails into a canyon — the last act happens on a collapsing bridge.  
- **Resolution:**  
  - PCs secure the coil (and optionally the Baron’s fate).  
  - Tinkwhistle teleports them out just as the wreckage collapses into dust.

## 🎭 Key Beats to Emphasize  
- **Cinematic Action:** Horseback chases, rooftop duels, shootouts between cars.  
- **Weird Science:** Explosions that freeze in midair, seconds of “rewound” time, déjà vu.  
- **Player Freedom:** They can fight, negotiate, perform, or clown their way through.  
- **Outcome Fixed:** They *must* retrieve the coil, but how they do it changes the drama (ally with a gang, betray everyone, outwit the Baron, etc.).
