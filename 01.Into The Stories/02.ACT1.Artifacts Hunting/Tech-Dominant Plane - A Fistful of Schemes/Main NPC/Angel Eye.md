# ✦ Angel Eye

## **1. High-Level Concept**

A calm, polite, soft-spoken gunman whose presence alone is unsettling.  
A professional who never shows anger, rarely raises his voice, and always **knows more than he should**.

He doesn’t work for Red Jack.  
He doesn’t work for Marshal Kane.  
He doesn’t work for Baron Blackthorn.

He works for **himself**, and for the **highest bidder**—  
but that bidder sometimes changes based on multiversal interests beyond The Frontier.

He is dangerous because:

- he is **predictable in method**,
- but **unpredictable in allegiance**.

He truly believes every life has a price, including his own.

---

# ✦ 2. Core Personality

### **Tone & Speech**

- Always calm, slow, polite.
- Never curses.
- Rarely smiles, but when he does, it’s wrong.
- Keeps sentences short.
- Speaks as though he’s _observing_ the party, not _talking to_ them.

### **Examples of vocal style:**

- “I see.”
- “That’s interesting.”
- “If that’s what you think.”
- “People do strange things… when they’re afraid.”

### **Behavior**

- Never raises his voice.
- Never rushes.
- Eats and drinks neatly.
- Adjusts his white-handled revolver when thinking.
- Watches exits, never people.

### **Philosophy**

- “Semua orang berhenti bernapas pada waktunya.  
    Yang berbeda hanya siapa yang dibayar untuk memastikan hal itu terjadi.”

# ✦ 3. Goals & Secrets
### **Short-Term Goals (The Frontier Arc)**

- Observe Red Jack’s heist.
- Observe Marshal Kane’s defenses.
- Identify who truly controls the kereta Baron Blackthorn.

### **Long-Term Goals (Boundless & Timeless)**

- Evaluate the Artifact’s value—not in gold, but in **planar influence**.
- Determine whether Ao or the Pantheon has the stronger hand.
- Decide whether the party is:
    - a **useful asset**
    - a **future threat**
    - or **something worth investing in**

### **Absolute Secret**

> Ivory Eye is a **planar-aware human**, one of the few in The Frontier who senses the existence of Ao, Weave, and pantheon struggle — although he does **not** know the full truth.

He just knows **the world isn’t as simple** as horses, saloons, and gunsmoke.

---

# ✦ 4. Appearance & Atmosphere

### **Look**

- Dark coat, dust-worn.
- Black hat.
- Pale blue eyes.
- White-ivory handled revolver in a holster tied low on the thigh.
- Thin smile.
- Finger always rests near his belt buckle—not his gun—because he never needs to hurry.

### **Presence**

When he enters a room:

- conversations quiet down
- people step aside
- not because they fear him
- but because **they don’t want to accidentally inconvenience him**

# ✦ 5. How to Roleplay Him at the Table

### **When speaking to the party:**

- Ask questions instead of giving statements.
- Don’t react emotionally.
- Compliment and insult at the same time.
- Make the party feel _seen_.

**Example lines:**

- “Kalian membuat banyak teman hari ini.  
    Lebih banyak lagi musuh.”

- “Aku menghargai orang yang punya tekad.  
    Itu membuat mereka mudah diprediksi.”

- “Aku tidak di pihak siapa pun.  
    Aku hanya memilih… waktu yang tepat.”

### **When he knows something secret:**

- “Kalian bukan orang pertama yang mencari itu.”
- “Seseorang membayar sangat mahal agar aku tidak ikut campur.”
- “Sepertinya aku harus… mempertimbangkan ulang kontrakku.”

---

# ✦ 6. Combat Philosophy (if he’s forced to fight)

He never starts fights.  
He only ends them.  
He aims for:

- kneecaps
- wrists
- heart
- head (only if necessary)

He prefers:

- **ambush**
- **clean kills**
- **one-shot resolutions**

---

# ✦ 7. STAT BLOCK (D&D 5e – Low Magic Frontier)

You can scale him depending on level of party.  
This is tuned for parties around **level 5–7**.
